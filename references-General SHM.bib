  note = {Axiom I: All materials have inherent flaws or defects.\\
Axiom II: The assessment of damage requires a comparison between two system\\
states.\\
Axiom III: Identifying the existence and location of damage can be done in an\\
unsupervised learningmode, but identifying the type of damage present and the\\
damage severity can generally only be done in a supervised learning mode.\\
Axiom IVa: Sensors cannot measure damage. Feature extraction through\\
signal processing and statistical classification is necessary to convert sensor\\
data into damage information.\\
Axiom IVb: Without intelligent feature extraction, the more sensitive a\\
measurement is to damage, themore sensitive it is to changing operational and\\
environmental conditions.\\
Axiom V: The length- and time-scales associated with damage initiation and\\
evolution dictate the required properties of the SHM sensing system.\\
Axiom VI: There is a trade-off between the sensitivity to damage of an\\
algorithm and its noise rejection capability.\\
Axiom VII: The size of damage that can be detected from changes in system\\
dynamics is inversely proportional to the frequency range of excitation.},

  abstract = {This book highlights the applications of data mining technologies in structural dynamic analysis, including structural design, optimization, parameter identification, model updating, damage identification, in civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering. These engineering applications require precise structural design, fabrication, inspection, and further monitoring to obtain a full life-cycle analysis, and by focusing on data processing, data mining technologies offer another aspect in structural dynamic analysis. Discussing techniques in time/frequency domain, such as Hilbert transforms, wavelet theory, and machine learning for structural dynamic analysis to help in structural monitoring and diagnosis, the book is an essential reference resource for beginners, graduates and industrial professionals in various fields.},
