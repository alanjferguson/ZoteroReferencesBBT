  abstract = {The motivation behind this paper is to develop a spectral-based damage detection and damage localization scheme using in-service ambient vibration in the context of non–model-based damage characterization. In this regard, a response parameter known as spectral moment is implemented for structural damage identification. The damage identification procedure starts with developing response power spectral density (PSD). The principal structural response features are then extracted from the frequency distribution of the spectrum using spectral moments. It is demonstrated that, although, spectral moment is a nonmodal characteristic of a process, it is related to modal parameters of a response signal since the spectral moment at each location is proportional to its corresponding modal vector. Hence, it is expected that due to damage occurrence spectral moment undergoes a variation. On this point, a damage sensitive feature is defined by comparing the spectral moments of two successive states of the structure. It is demonstrated that at a damage location there is a pronounced distinctive change in the indicative feature which is implemented for damage localization. The major advantages of the method include, first, the method works based on output-only measurement data, and second, it does not require any representative model of the structure and finally, unlike modal data that provides information at specific frequencies, the presented method is a broadband approach using information in a wide frequency range. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique was validated by numerical simulations and an experimental case study. A series of numerical simulations with different damage scenarios was carried out on an Euler-Bernoulli beam subject to a band-limited random Gaussian excitation. Damage was simulated by reducing the flexural rigidity of elements at particular locations in single or multiple states. An experimental case study was also investigated utilizing a reinforced concrete jack arch which is one of the major structural components of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Damage was introduced by creating a crack via applying gradual load using load cell. The numerical and experimental analyses indicated a promising sensitivity of the approach to detect and localize structural damage.

It investigates not only frequency shifts due to various vehicle positions, but also changes in the shape of the modes of vibration. Two different bridges were instrumented and loaded by traversing trucks or trucks momentarily stationed on the bridge. The measurements were analysed by means of an output-only technique and a novel use of the continuous wavelet transform, which is presented here for the first time. The analysis reveals the presence of additional frequencies, significant shifts in frequencies and changes in the modes of vibration. These phenomena are theoretically investigated with the support of a simplified numerical model. This paper offers an interpretation of vehicle-bridge interaction of two particular case studies.

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel methodology for structural health monitoring of a bridge is presented with implementations for bridge load rating using sensor and video image data from operating traffic. With this methodology, video images are analyzed by means of computer vision techniques to detect and track vehicles crossing the bridge. Traditional sensor data are correlated with computer images to extract unit influence lines (UILs). Based on laboratory studies, UILs can be extracted for a critical section with different vehicles by means of synchronized video and sensor data. The synchronized computer vision and strain measurements can be obtained for bridge load rating under operational traffic. For this, the following are presented: a real life bridge is instrumented and monitored, and the real-life data are processed under a moving load. A detailed finite-element model (FEM) of the bridge is also developed and presented along with the experimental measurements to support the applicability of the approach for load rating using UILs extracted from operating traffic. The load rating of the bridges using operational traffic in real life was validated with the FEM results of the bridge and the simulation of the operational traffic on the bridge. This approach is further proven with different vehicles captured with video and measurements. The UILs are used for load rating by multiplying the UIL vector of the critical section with the load vector from the HL-93 design truck. The load rating based on the UIL is compared with the FEM results and indicates good agreement. With this method, it is possible to extract UILs of bridges under regular traffic and obtain load rating efficiently.

Due to their biomechanics origin, these devices combine a triaxial accelerometer with gyroscopes and magnetometers for orientation, as well as on board data logging capability and wireless communication for optional data streaming and to coordinate synchronisation with other IMUs in a network. The motivation for application to civil structures is that their capabilities and simple operating procedures make them suitable for modal testing of many types of civil infrastructure of limited dimension including footbridges and floors while also enabling recovering of dynamic forces generated and applied to structures by moving humans. To explore their capabilities in civil applications, the IMUs are evaluated through modal tests on three different structures with increasing challenge of spatial and environmental complexity. These are, a full-scale floor mock-up in a laboratory, a short span road bridge and a seven story office tower. For each case, the results from the IMUs are compared with those from a conventional wired system to identify the limitations. The main conclusion is that the relatively high noise floor and limited communication range will not be a serious limitation in the great majority of typical civil modal test applications where convenient operation is a significant advantage over conventional wired systems.},

This paper introduces a new method of identifying bridge damage using an instrumented truck; specifically using the truck acceleration histories to calculate changes in the “bridge displacement profile” which is shown to be sensitive to structural damage. The study includes three different bridges modeled as 1D FE beam elements and 2D FE plate elements. The simulation of the vehicle–bridge interaction is implemented in MATLAB. The truck is represented as a simple quarter car model crossing over a rough profile. The approach is also numerically tested for local damage in the bridge plate model. Finally, there is a study of sensitivity to signal noise, corrupted truck properties, initial conditions and transverse vehicle position.},

  abstract = {The cross-correlation function between two response measurements made on an ambiently excited structure is shown to have the same form as the system's impulse response function. Therefore, standard time domain curve-fitting procedures, which are typically applied to impulse response functions, can now be applied to the cross-correlation functions to estimate the resonant frequencies and modal damping of the structure. This derivation is based on the assumption that the ambient vibration source is a white noise random process. Curve-fitting cross-correlation functions to obtain modal properties offers advantages over standard procedures that identify resonant frequencies from peaks in the power spectrum and damping from the width of the power spectrum. The primary advantage is the ability to identify closely spaced modes and their associated damping. The resonant frequencies of a highway bridge that were identified by curve-fitting the cross-correlation functions, using traffic excitation as the ambient vibration source, are compared to modal properties identified by standard forced vibration testing methods. Results of this comparison showed a maximum discrepancy of 3·63 percent. Similar comparisons for the average modal damping values identified by the two methods showed a 9·82 percent difference. This experimental verification implies that the proposed method of analyzing ambient vibration data can be used to accurately assess the dynamic properties of structures in a non-intrusive manner.},

  abstract = {In recent years there have been a growing number of publications on procedures for damage detection in beams from analysing their dynamic response to the passage of a moving force. Most of this research demonstrates their effectiveness by showing that a singularity that did not appear in the healthy structure is present in the response of the damaged structure. This paper elucidates from first principles how the acceleration response can be assumed to consist of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ components, and where the beam has experienced a localised loss in stiffness, an additional ‘damage’ component. The combination of these components establishes how the damage singularity will appear in the total response. For a given damage severity, the amplitude of the ‘damage’ component will depend on how close the damage location is to the sensor, and its frequency content will increase with higher velocities of the moving force. The latter has implications for damage detection because if the frequency content of the ‘damage’ component includes bridge and/or vehicle frequencies, it becomes more difficult to identify damage. The paper illustrates how a thorough understanding of the relationship between the ‘static’ and ‘damage’ components contributes to establish if damage has occurred and to provide an estimation of its location and severity. The findings are corroborated using accelerations from a planar finite element simulation model where the effects of force velocity and bridge span are examined.},

  abstract = {This paper pays specific attention to measuring and identifying the behaviour of the bridge bearings of a short span highway bridge, as well as the static and dynamic data commonly used for model updating. This is important because while it is widely accepted that correct simulation of boundary conditions in a Finite Element (FE) model is crucial to the accuracy of the model, few researchers have actually attempted to measure bearing movement as part of their model updating strategy. To demonstrate the approach and the benefits of tracking bearing movement two separate updated FE models of the bridge were developed; (i) was updated using dynamic performance information, and (ii) was updated using response to quasi-static loading. The inclusion of bearing behaviour data proved to be very important, as in (i) it was found that during ambient vibration testing with low level dynamic response to light traffic, the friction on the bridge bearings was such that they were effectively behaving as ‘pinned-pinned’, as opposed to ‘pinned-roller’ as indicated by the bridge drawings. Using this observation it was possible to get the updated model (i) to match very closely with the experimentally measured frequencies and mode shapes. Without this information, conventional model updating optimisation would likely have driven the system parameters (e.g. Young’s modulus, deck mass) to unrealistic values in order to get the FE predictions to match the experimentally observed frequencies. For the static model (ii) it was again observed that friction on the bearing was playing a significant role in the behaviour of the bridge and this was exploited to develop a simple but effective updated FE model that accurately predicted the bridge response during two separate static load tests. No single FE model could represent the bridge for both types of loading but in both cases the bearing performance data were critical in getting the relevant model to match the experimentally observed values.},

  abstract = {Bridge failure to pass load capacity assessment is unfortunately not an uncommon problem in bridge engineering and it is a potentially expensive problem for the bridge owner. Using load test data to justify increase in assessed load capacity is recognised as a viable approach in professional codes of practice. However, load tests are rarely carried out in practice because traditionally they are expensive to conduct and may not always justify an increase in assessed load capacity. Therefore this paper proposes a simple, quick and reliable approach for bridge load testing. In particular a procedure to calculate the bridge displacement to a moving truck by double integration of bridge acceleration is presented. Integrating acceleration to calculate displacement is not a new approach, with authors reporting difficulties due to errors in acceleration signals and unknown initial conditions. Many of the previous approaches have focused on developing signal processing algorithms to correct for the signal errors and while some good results have been reported, typically the derived displacements are very sensitive to parameters used in the correction algorithm, such as passband filter frequencies. Consequently, without comparison with directly measured displacement data, reliability of the procedure cannot be established and errors quantified. Therefore in this study a stripped down procedure is applied placing emphasis instead on minimising the errors in the recorded acceleration by using appropriate hardware and developing a quality control procedure that allows the user to assess the likely accuracy of the calculated displacement signal. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is trialled in the laboratory and in the field, with an accuracy of ±0.5 mm observed.},

  abstract = {Previous research based on theoretical simulations has shown the potential of the wavelet transform to detect damage in a beam by analysing the time-deflection response due to a constant moving load. However, its application to identify damage from the response of a bridge to a vehicle raises a number of questions. Firstly, it may be difficult to record the difference in the deflection signal between a healthy and a slightly damaged structure to the required level of accuracy and high scanning frequencies in the field. Secondly, the bridge is going to have a road profile and it will be loaded by a sprung vehicle and time-varying forces rather than a constant load. Therefore, an algorithm based on a plot of wavelet coefficients versus time to detect damage (a singularity in the plot) appears to be very sensitive to noise. This paper addresses these questions by: (a) using the acceleration signal, instead of the deflection signal, (b) employing a vehicle–bridge finite element interaction model, and (c) developing a novel wavelet-based approach using wavelet energy content at each bridge section, which proves to be more sensitive to damage than a wavelet coefficient line plot at a given scale as employed by others.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel bridge condition assessment methodology using direct rotation measurements. Initially, numerical analyses are carried out to develop the theoretical basis of the proposed bridge damage detection methodology. As a result of this study the difference in rotation influence lines obtained for healthy and damaged bridge states is proposed as a damage indicator. The sensitivity of rotation to damage and the effect of sensor locations on sensor sensitivities are investigated. Subsequently, extensive laboratory experiments are conducted on a 5.4\,m long simply supported bridge structure in an effort to validate the results from the numerical analyses. The test structure is instrumented with rotation sensors and axle detectors and loaded with a four-axle moving vehicle. In this study, rotations are measured using high grade uniaxial accelerometers. The procedure of measuring rotations using accelerometers is explained within the scope of this study. To test the robustness of the proposed bridge condition assessment methodology, a wide range of single and multiple damage scenarios is investigated and the results from this study show that the proposed methodology can successfully identify damage on a bridge. For the model considered, damage as low as 7\% change in stiffness over an extent of 2.5\% bridge span is shown to be detectable.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing is a computing paradigm wherein computing resources, such as servers, storage and applications, can be provisioned and accessed in real time via advanced communication networks. In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and big data, cloud computing has been widely developed in many industrial applications involving large volume of data. Appropriate use of cloud computing infrastructure can enhance the long-term deployment of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system which would incur significant amount of data of different types. This paper presents a cloud-based cyberinfrastructure platform designed to support bridge monitoring. The cyberinfrastructure platform enables scalable management of SHM data and facilitates effective information sharing and data utilisation. A cloud-based platform comprises of virtual machines, distributed database and web servers. The peer-to-peer distributed database architecture provides a scalable and fault-tolerant data management system. Platform-neutral web services designed in compliant with the Representational State Transfer (REST) standard enables easy access to the cloud resources and SHM data. For data interoperability, a bridge information model for bridge monitoring applications is adopted. For demonstration, the scalable cloud-based platform is implemented for the monitoring of bridges along the I-275 corridor in the State of Michigan. The results show that the cloud-based cyberinfrastructure platform can effectively manage the sensor data and bridge information and facilitate efficient access of the data as well as the bridge monitoring software services.},

Structural health monitoring has the potential to make structures safer by observing both long-term structural changes and immediate postdisaster damage.

The scale-model structure adopted for use in this benchmark problem is described. Then, two analytical models based on the structure—one a 12 degree of freedom ͑DOF͒ shear-building model, the other a 120-DOF model, both finite element based—are given. The damage patterns to be identified are listed as well as the types and number of sensors, magnitude of sensor noise, and so forth.

Conventional displacement gauges or GPS based systems have limitations in terms of access to the infrastructure and accuracy. The system introduced in this paper provides a low cost durable alternative which is rapidly deployable in the field and does not require direct contact or access to the infrastructure or its vicinity. A commercial action camera was modified to facilitate the use of a telescopic lens and paired with the development of robust displacement identification algorithms based on pattern matching. Performance was evaluated first in a series of controlled laboratory tests and validated against displacement measurements obtained using a fibre optic displacement gauge. The efficiency of the system for field applications was then demonstrated by capturing the validated bridge response of two structures under live loading including the iconic peace bridge. Located in the City of Derry, Northern Ireland, the Peace Bridge is a 310 m curved self-anchored suspension pedestrian bridge structure. The vision-based results of the field experiment were confirmed against displacements calculated from measured accelerations during a dynamic assessment of the structure under crowd loading. In field applications the developed system can achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 mm against verified measurements.},

A self-tuning learning method for structural condition assessment was proposed. Damage sensitive features were extracted using a frequency domain decomposition (FDD) approach to fuse all the measured responses, followed by random projection algorithm for dimensionality reduction. An automatic parameter selection method called Appropriate Distance to the Enclosing Surface (ADES) was used for tuning the classifier parameter. The effect of operational conditions on the robustness of the proposed method was also investigated, and it was realized that application of FDD to extract damage sensitive feature reduces the variation in the results. Promising results in the assessment of damage were obtained based on two comprehensive case studies, which included single and multiple damage scenarios. The contributions of the work are threefold. First, through two comprehensive case studies, we demonstrate that the frequency-based feature from a single sensor might not be adequate enough to detect the progress of damage, even if the sensor is in the vicinity of damage. Second, we show that data fusion using FDD can reliably assess the severity of damage, and finally, we propose a new automated approach for tuning the classifier parameter.},

  abstract = {Health monitoring systems set up to assure the safe operation of structures require linking sensors with computational tools able to interpret sensor data in terms of structural performance. Although intensive development continues on innovative sensor systems, there is still considerable uncertainty in deciding on the number of sensors required and their location in order to obtain adequate information on structural behaviour. This paper considers the problem of locating sensors on a bridge structure with the aim of maximizing the data information so that structural dynamic behaviour can be fully characterised. Six different optimal sensor placement techniques, three based on the maximisation of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), one on the properties of the covariance matrix coefficients, and two on energetic approaches, have been investigated. Mode shape displacements were taken as the measured data set and two comparison criteria were employed. The first criterion was based on the mean square error between the FE model and the cubic spline interpolated mode shapes. The second criterion measured the information content of each sensor location to investigate on the strength of the acquired signals and their ability to withstand the noise pollution keeping intact the information relative to the structure properties. The results showed that the effective independence driving-point residue (EFI-DPR) method provides an effective method for optimal sensor placement to identify the vibration characteristics of the studied bridge. The variance method (VM) developed by the authors gave results very close to the EFI-DPR technique, in terms of the capability to capture the vibration mode shape and signal strength. However, the VM presented unique characteristics in the world of the OSP techniques, which is the indication of the optimal number of sensors (ONS).},

However, for bridges this is complicated by the changing environmental and operational conditions which also have an effect on the natural frequencies. Consequently, much of the research effort has been on trying to develop data modelling approaches that correct for, or removes, environmental effects so that changes in structural behaviour can be revealed. However, the fact that the process of extracting frequencies from bridge response data sets has in itself some inherent uncertainties has been largely ignored, forms the major interest of this study. In this paper, various methods for extracting frequency data from time domain signals are reviewed, and their suitability for use in automated approaches discussed. A selection of these methods were then used to obtain frequencies from a continuous acceleration data from a bridge over a 20-day period. Comparisons were then made between the obtained frequencies and any observed differences highlighted between the methods.},

  abstract = {Bridge scour is the number one cause of failure in bridges located over waterways. Scour leads to rapid losses in foundation stiffness and can cause sudden collapse. Previous research on bridge health monitoring has used changes in natural frequency to identify damage in bridge beams. The possibility of using a similar approach to identifying scour is investigated in this paper. To assess if this approach is feasible, it is necessary to establish how scour affects the natural frequency of a bridge, and if it is possible to measure changes in frequency using the bridge dynamic response to a passing vehicle. To address these questions, a novel vehicle–bridge–soil interaction (VBSI) model was developed. By carrying out a modal study in this model, it is shown that for a wide range of possible soil states, there is a clear reduction in the natural frequency of the first mode of the bridge with scour. Moreover, it is shown that the response signals on the bridge from vehicular loading are sufficient to allow these changes in frequency to be detected.

  abstract = {Scour around bridge foundations is one of the leading causes of bridge failure. Up until recently, the monitoring of this phenomenon was primarily based around using underwater instrumentation to monitor the progression of scour holes as they develop around foundation systems. Vibration-based damage detection techniques have been used to detect damage in bridge beams. The application of these vibration based methods to the detection of scour has come to the fore in research in recent years. This paper examines the effect that scour has on the frequency response of a driven pile foundation system, similar to those used to support road and rail bridges. The effect of scour on the vibration characteristics of the pile is examined using laboratory and field testing. It is clear that there is a very clear reduction in the natural frequency of the pile as the severity of scour increases. It is shown that by combining state-of-the-art geotechnical techniques with relatively simple finite element modelling approaches, it is possible to accurately predict the natural frequency of the pile for a given scour depth. Therefore, the paper proposes a method that would allow the estimation of scour depth for a given observed pile frequency.},

However, the data analysis techniques and, in particular, the technology conceived years ago that are necessary for accurately and efficiently extracting condition assessment measures from highway infrastructure have just recently begun maturation. In this study, a large-scale wireless sensor network is deployed for ambient vibration testing of a single-span integral abutment bridge to derive in-service modal parameters. Dynamic behavior of the structure from ambient and traffic loads was measured with accelerometers for experimental determination of the natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of the bridge. Real-time data collection from a 40-channel single network operating with a sampling rate of 128~Hz per sensor was achieved with essentially lossless data transmission. Successful acquisition of high-rate, lossless data on the highway bridge validates the proprietary wireless network protocol within an actual service environment. Operational modal analysis is performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the acquisition hardware with additional correlation of the derived modal parameters to a Finite Element Analysis of a model developed using as-built drawings to check plausibility of the mode shapes. Results from this testing demonstrate that wireless sensor technology has matured to the degree that modal analysis of large civil structures with a distributed network is a currently feasible and a comparable alternative to cable-based measurement approaches.},

  abstract = {Displacement data under operational loads are an important aid for the estimation of structural performance, but accurate measurement of structural displacement remains as a challenging task, especially for long-span bridges. The global positioning system (GPS) is the common choice for long-span bridge displacement monitoring but the measurement accuracy is not satisfactory. The purpose of this study is to improve the GPS accuracy using a practical data fusion method. Although the main algorithms of data fusion method based on multi-rate Kalman filter are already reported, the detail about how to select the noise parameters required for Kalman filter is not provided. This paper demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be used to determine the necessary noise parameters. The proposed approach was validated on numerical and field data, the latter from a single-day displacement monitoring campaign on the Humber Bridge in the UK. The direct measurement by GPS was merged with the collocated acceleration data and the resulting displacement signal was evaluated by comparing it to the displacement signal from an independent vision-based system. Through the comparison, it is shown that MLE enhanced data fusion is practical to improve the GPS measurement accuracy and to widen the frequency bandwidth. The MLE provides an estimation about the GPS noise (assumed as zero-mean Gaussian process) with the standard deviation varying from 6 mm to 16 mm in the test day. The normalised root mean square deviation of GPS measurement compared with the vision-based measurement was decreased from 3.17\% to 2.37\% after applying the data fusion.},

  abstract = {This study is devoted to the experimental validation of the multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction method for structural health monitoring of long-span suspension bridges. The method for multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction is briefly described. A test bed, comprising of a physical model and an updated finite element (FE) model of a long-span suspension bridge is also concisely introduced. The proposed method is then applied to the test bed; the equation of motion of the test bed subject to ground motion, the objective function for sensor location optimization, the principles for mode selection and multi-type response reconstruction are established. A numerical study using the updated FE model is performed to select the sensor types, numbers, and locations. Subsequently, with the identified sensor locations and some practical considerations, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, laser displacement transducers, and accelerometers are installed on the physical bridge model. Finally, experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the reconstructed responses using the measured responses from the limited number of multi-type sensors agree well with the actual bridge responses. The proposed method is validated to be feasible and effective for the monitoring of structural behavior of long-span suspension bridges.},

  abstract = {Careful selection and placement of sensors are the critical issue in the construction and implementation of an effective structural health monitoring system. A hybrid method termed the optimal sensor placement strategy (OSPS) based on multiple optimization methods is proposed in this paper. The initial sensor placement is firstly obtained by the QR factorization. Then, using the minimization of the off-diagonal elements in the modal assurance criterion matrix as a measure of the utility of a sensor configuration, the quantity of the sensors is determined by the forward and backward sequential sensor placement algorithm together. Finally, the locations of the sensor are determined by the dual-structure coding-based generalized genetic algorithm (GGA). Taking the scientific calculation software matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as a platform, an OSPS toolbox, which is working as a black box, is developed based on the command-line compiling and graphical user interface-aided graphical interface design. The characteristic and operation method of the toolbox are introduced in detail, and the scheme selection of the OSP is carried out on the world's tallest TV tower (Guangzhou New TV Tower) based on the developed toolbox. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective and the software package has a friendly interface, plenty of functions, good expansibility and is easy to operate, which can be easily applied in practical engineering.
