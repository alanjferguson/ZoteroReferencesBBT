  abstract = {This study proposes a new damage identification technique for condition assessment of bridge structures. The method is based on the concept of rotation influence line (RIL) at the bridge bearing locations, and solely relies on measurements obtained from two points at either end of the bridge e.g., RILR and RILL. The sensitivity of the rotation measurement to damage is first investigated using a 1-D simply supported beam model and it is demonstrated that unlike conventional strain measurements, the rotation measurement is capable of providing useful information about damage even though it is far from the measurement point. Further, an existing cable-stayed bridge is considered to validate the capability of RIL in damage identification. A comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of the bridge is established and calibrated using the measured static and dynamic responses. Numerous field tests are conducted on this large-scale structure to extract static and dynamic characteristics, including natural frequencies, mode shapes and influence lines (ILs). Sixteen hypothetical damage scenarios are induced in the numerical model, including symmetric and asymmetric cases of cable loss. A damage index based on the normalised discrepancy of RIL between the benchmark state and an unknown state is introduced and through extensive investigations it is demonstrated that regardless of damage location, either RILR or RILL (or both) can successfully identify the induced damage in all of the sixteen damage scenarios. In contrast, the success of strain-based measurement is highly dependent on the closeness of damage to the sensor location, thus a much higher number of strain gauge sensors is required not to misidentify damage. The contribution of this work is four-fold. First, a novel and robust damage identification technique based on RIL is proposed which has not been reported in the literature. Second, the method solely relies on two measurement points e.g., two tilt meters at either end of the bridge and it is capable of identifying damage, even far from the sensor location. Third, the validation of the technique is demonstrated through extensive numerical and field test investigations on a statically indeterminate cable-stayed bridge structure. Finally, it is demonstrated that the conventional strain-based measurement is very likely to misidentify cable damage even with extreme case of cable loss.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a case study of a post-tensioned reinforced concrete bridge built in the 1970s which underwent a two month monitoring period prior to its demolition. The 62 m long two-lane bridge was to be replaced by a newer construction designed for higher traffic loads and was thus available for in-situ trials once it had been closed to traffic. The monitoring started in February 2016 to observe the three-span structure in its original state when excited by ambient and vehicle-induced vibrations. Initial construction works around the sloping abutment and the pier foundations, such as pile driving and extension of the embankment, started at the end of March, followed by the closure to traffic and the removal of the asphalt pavement. Over the next few weeks, the bridge saw three damage scenarios induced in the following order: 1. Six out of sixteen tension cables were severed above one of the piers; 2. Expansive mortar was filled into boreholes in the deck; 3. Expansive mortar was filled into boreholes in one of the piers to induce cracking. The bridge was equipped with accelerometers, inclination sensors and fibre-optic strain gauges that continuously monitored the structure’s condition. For safety reasons, the sensors in direct vicinity of the damage points were gradually moved to other parts of the bridge or dismantled completely in the course of the damage infliction. The aim of the monitoring was to assess the detectability of the structural weakening using a variety of measurement techniques and to see what role data quality, sensor positioning and auxiliary information plays in reliably diagnosing the extent of the damage or defining an alarm level. Different ways of post-processing the data were examined to see what information can be gained without having to create a numerical model of the structure when insufficient design documents are available.},

  abstract = {The recent rapid development of rotation rate sensor technology opens new opportunities for their application in more and more fields. In this paper, the potential of rotational sensors for the modal analysis of full-scale civil engineering structural elements is experimentally examined. For this purpose, vibrations of two 6-m long beams made of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) were measured using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) rotation rate sensors. The beams were excited to vibrations using an impact hammer and a dynamic vibration exciter. The results of the experiment show that by using rotation rate sensors, one can directly obtain derivatives of mode shapes and deflection shapes. These derivatives of mode shapes, often called “rotational modes”, bring more information regarding possible local stiffness variations than the traditional transversal and deflection mode shapes, so their extraction during structural health monitoring is particularly useful. Previously, the rotational modes could only be obtained indirectly (e.g., by central difference approximation). Here, with the application of rotation rate sensors, one can obtain rotational modes and deflection shapes with a higher precision. Furthermore, the average strain rate and dynamic strain were acquired using the rotation rate sensors. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that rotation rate sensors were matured enough to be used in the monitoring and modal analyses of full-scale civil engineering elements (e.g., reinforced concrete beams).},

  abstract = {The resilience of the built environment to extreme weather events is fundamental for the day-to-day operation of our transport network, with scour representing one of the biggest threats to bridges built over flowing water. Condition monitoring of the bridge using a structural health monitoring system enhances resilience by reducing the time needed to return the bridge to normal use by providing timely information on structural condition and safety. The work presented in this report discusses use of rotational measurements in structural health monitoring. Traditionally tiltmeters (which can be a form of DC accelerometer) are used to measure rotation but are known to be affected by dynamic movements, while gyroscopes react quickly to dynamic motion but drift over time. This review will introduce gyroscopes as a complementary sensor for accelerometer rotational measurements and use sensor fusion techniques to combine the measurements from both sensors to get an optimised rotational result. This method was trialled on a laboratory scaled model, before the system was installed on an in-service single-span skewed railway bridge. The rotational measurements were compared against rotation measurements obtained using a vision-based measurement system to confirm the validity of the results. An introduction to gyroscopes, field test measurement results with the sensors and their correlation with the vision-based measurement results are presented in this article.},

  abstract = {Monitoring deflections provides a powerful diagnostic tool for structural health monitoring of bridges. Excessive deflections under service loads may be indicative of structural changes, damage and deterioration. For the real time monitoring of deflections under operating traffic loads, it is often difficult to establish a fixed reference point for displacement transducers either because the bridge crosses over a body of water or a roadway. Moreover, vandalism and environmental conditions disrupt and more than likely alter the fixity of the reference points. The work presented in this study pertains to the development of a method for real time remote monitoring of bridge deflections. From the practical point of view, the primary attribute of the proposed method is its capability for making reference free estimates of bridge deflections. The formulations employ the measured rotations and curvatures of the bridge for this purpose. The feasibility of the approach was tested on two different highway bridges. Both bridges were instrumented with a number of different fiber optic sensors that included tiltmeters and strain gauges. Conventional transducers and displacement measurement devices were also used in parallel in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A series of load tests were conducted at both bridge sites that included use of trucks with known weights. In addition, finite element models were developed and employed for further verification of the proposed approach. Field test measurement results and their correlations with the conventional methods as well as comparison with the finite element models are described in this article. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The information obtained from B-WIM systems has been used for a wide range of applications such as pre-selection for weight enforcement, traffic management/planning and for bridge and pavement design. However, it is less often used for bridge condition assessment purposes which is the main focus of this study. This paper presents a bridge damage detection concept using information provided by B-WIM systems. However, conventional B-WIM systems use strain measurements which are not sensitive to local damage. In this paper the authors present a B-WIM formulation that uses rotation measurements obtained at the bridge supports. There is a linear relationship between support rotation and axle weight and, unlike strain, rotation is sensitive to damage anywhere in the bridge. Initially, the sensitivity of rotation to damage is investigated using a hypothetical simply supported bridge model. Having seen that rotation is damage-sensitive, the influence of bridge damage on weight predictions is analysed. It is shown that if damage occurs, a rotation-based B-WIM system will continuously overestimate the weight of traversing vehicles. Finally, the statistical repeatability of ambient traffic is studied using real traffic data obtained from a Weigh-in-Motion site in the U.S. under the Federal Highway Administration’s Long-Term Pavement Performance programme and a damage indicator is proposed as the change in the mean weights of ambient traffic data. To test the robustness of the proposed damage detection methodology numerical analysis are carried out on a simply supported bridge model and results are presented within the scope of this study.},

  abstract = {To implement steel bridge maintenance, especially that related to fatigue damage, it is important to monitor bridge deformations under traffic conditions. Bridges deform and rotate differently under traffic load conditions because their structures differ in terms of length and flexibility. Such monitoring enables the identification of the cause of stress concentrations that cause fatigue damage and the proposal of appropriate countermeasures. However, although bridge deformation monitoring requires observations of bridge angle response as well as the bridge displacement response, measuring the rotation angle response of a bridge subject to traffic loads is difficult. Theoretically, the rotation angle response can be calculated by integrating the angular velocity, but for field measurements of actual in-service bridges, estimating the necessary boundary conditions would be difficult due to traffic-induced vibration. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method for determining the rotation angle response of an in-service bridge from its angular velocity, as measured by a inertial measurement unit (IMU). To verify our proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) IMUs and two contact displacement gauges. The results showed that our proposed method provided high accuracy when compared to the reference responses calculated by the contact displacement gauges.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new real-time damage identification method has been presented for bridge structural health monitoring (SHM) considering temperature variation. The method utilizes model-based damage identification that involves three major steps: (1) efficient basis functions—extracted from finite-element (FE) models prior to real-time identification; (2) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses; and (3) the fusion of different types of structural responses into damage indicator. By treating local damages as equivalent vertical loads and then cross-referencing global (inclinations) and local (strain) data, the hidden damage information in bridge structures can be detected and localized in a timely fashion, even in the presence of unknown temperature variation as well as vehicle loads. Inclinations alone cannot reflect local damages, but by fusing inclinations and strains (that represent local damage) into the proposed damage indicator, local damages can be identified. Numerical simulations on a medium-span continuous bridge demonstrate that the proposed method is insensitive to measurement noise and some common modeling errors, revealing the potential of real-time damage identification in bridge SHM applications.},

  abstract = {A new framework for bridge-deflection estimation through inclinometer data is presented in this paper. Whether the structure is damaged or not, deflection could be precisely estimated via the finite-element model (FEM) combined with the partial least-square regression (PLSR) method. In addition, damage localization is achieved at the same time. First, the deflection of a damaged structure is equivalent to that of an undamaged structure but subjected to special virtual loads. Second, the basis functions used in regression are calculated by the FEM of the undamaged structure rather than pure mathematical derivations. Third, the PLSR model is built on the basis of these basis functions and measured inclination data. By solving the PLSR equation, all the nodal inclinations and corresponding nodal loads of the structure could be obtained despite a limited number of measured nodes. Finally, the rotation-displacement transfer matrix is derived to reconstruct deflection from estimated inclinations, and the changes in nodal loads are served as damage indicators. To verify its effectiveness, numerical simulations considering various damage scenarios and different noise levels are performed. The results indicate that the proposed method is quite accurate and reliable in deflection estimation, and it could provide rough damage localization as well, which reveals a great potential in the field of structural health monitoring. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
