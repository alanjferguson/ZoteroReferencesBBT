  abstract = {Geographically distributed data acquisition systems provide a challenge when synchronization of the data acquisition is required. Current products and research do not provide a low-cost, low-power solution suitable for use in the field. GPS receivers are commonly used for their precision, but their power consumption is excessive. In this paper we present a method for synchronizing geographically distributed systems via the NIST radio station WWVB. We present a prototype version for low-power distributed data acquisition which uses a WWVB receiver for synchronization. We also present the limitations of the method and the prototype, along with typical application issues and lessons learned during system implementation.},

Nevertheless, we argue in this paper that existing approaches introduce undesirable trade-offs. For example, while GPS offers excellent accuracy for outdoor deployments, the high cost and power consumption of GPS receivers make them prohibitive to many applications. Message-passing protocols, such as FTSP, introduce different sets of compromises and constraints. In this paper, we present an inexpensive and ultra-low power ({$<$}; 100 μA) mote peripheral, we term the Universal Time Signal Receiver, that leverages the availability of time signals transmitted by dedicated radio stations around the globe to provide access to UTC time with millisecond-level accuracy. We present experimental results measuring signal availability, quality of synchronization across motes, and power consumption. We show that the proposed universal time signal receiver achieves global time synchronization and for applications where millisecond-level precision is sufficient, it consumes up to 1,000 times less energy than GPS or FTSP.},

  abstract = {Clock steering is an important discipline within the time and frequency community as well as in cognate disciplines such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). In the latter, clock steering is a mandatory tool for realizations of time scales, which first are typically created by algorithms forming a paper clock. Often, this software solution of a time scale is already sufficient. However, sometimes a realization in the form of a frequency signal is feasible or even necessary. Future GNSSs concepts plan to use composite clocks consisting of several different clocks to achieve synchronization of satellites within one orbit with the system time. In this approach, a real clock output in the microwave regime is indispensable. Therefore, a real clock has to be steered against the paper clock to realize the composite clock. Consequently, steering techniques are an essential piece for obtaining a realization. Besides the number of algorithms to choose from, there are several parameters that need to be defined by the user to achieve the best performance for distinct scenarios. In this paper we compare the realization performance and applicability of two different steering techniques, namely linear-quadratic Gaussian control and pole placement, in a simplified hardware setup. The studied scenario consists of a steerable clock consisting of a micro phase stepper which changes the frequency of the output of an ovencontrolled quartz oscillator (OCXO) and a rubidium atomic clock (RB). The OCXO in turn is steered to follow the free-running RB as closely as possible. Steering the output of the OCXO introduces a new process in the clock. As a result, the Allan deviation of the steered clock shows a bump which location is dependent on the chosen control interval and steering technique. This has to be considered for the designated operation. We compare simulations of the clock steering with both techniques to real-data results from our laboratory.},

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring ͑SHM͒ is a promising field with widespread application in civil engineering. Structural health monitoring has the potential to make structures safer by observing both long-term structural changes and immediate postdisaster damage. However, the many SHM studies in the literature apply different monitoring methods to different structures, making side-by-side comparison of the methods difficult. This paper details the first phase in a benchmark SHM problem organized under the auspices of the IASC–ASCE Structural Health Monitoring Task Group. The scale-model structure adopted for use in this benchmark problem is described. Then, two analytical models based on the structure—one a 12 degree of freedom ͑DOF͒ shear-building model, the other a 120-DOF model, both finite element based—are given. The damage patterns to be identified are listed as well as the types and number of sensors, magnitude of sensor noise, and so forth. MATLAB computer codes to generate the response data for the various cases are explained. The codes, as well as details of the ongoing Task Group activities, are available on the Task Group web site at ͗http://wusceel.cive.wustl.edu/asce.shm/͘.},

One key issue with such networks is the development of a suitable medium access control (MAC) protocol for the purpose of transferring data from the sensor nodes to the infrastructural nodes. Here, we use a MAC protocol based on time division multiplexing (TDM) and propose the use of the Rugby MSF broadcast as a synchronisation signal. This novel technique is investigated and some preliminary analysis is outlined.},

  abstract = {We propose RT-link, a time-synchronized link protocol for real-time wireless communication in industrial control, surveillance and inventory tracking. RT-link provides predictable lifetime for battery-operated embedded nodes, bounded end-to-end delay across multiple hops, and collision-free operation. We investigate the use of hardware-based time-synchronization for infrastructure nodes by using an AM carrier-current radio for indoors and atomic clock receivers for outdoors. Mobile nodes are synchronized via in-band software synchronization within the same framework. We identify three key observations in the design and deployment of RT-link: (a) hardware-based global-time synchronization is a robust and scalable option to in-band software-based techniques, (b) achieving global time-synchronization is both economical and convenient for indoor and outdoor deployments, (c) RT-link achieves a practical lifetime of over 2 years. Through analysis and simulation, we show that RT-link outperforms energy-efficient link protocols such as B-MAC in terms of node lifetime and end-to-end latency. The protocol supports flexible services such as on-demand end-to-end rate control and logical topology control. We implemented RT-link on the CMU FireFly sensor platform and have integrated it within the nano-RK real-time sensor OS. A 42-node network with sub-20 mus synchronization accuracy has been deployed for 3 weeks in the NIOSH Mining Research Laboratory and within two 5-story campus buildings},

The SC relies on a classic Proportional Integral (PI) controller, which has been properly tuned to minimize the synchronization error due to the local oscillator triggering the on-board timer. The SC has been implemented into a PMU prototype developed within the OpenPMU project using a BeagleBone Black (BBB) board. The distinctive feature of the proposed solution is its ability to track an input Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) reference with good long-term stability and with no need for specific on-board synchronization circuitry. Indeed, the SC implementation relies only on one co-processor for real-time application and requires just an input PPS signal that could be distributed from a single substation clock.},

Standard DCF77 receivers consist of AM long wave receiver circuit, connected to a data processing unit. Whole AM receiver circuit is often integrated into a chip with some external components. Such circuit gives demodulated logical data output, which can be led right to the processor to be decoded and presented. The idea is to remove the analog demodulator and process the amplified RF signal also on the processor. Specialized AM radio chip then would be replaced by a simple amplifier, e.g. operational amplifier circuit. Nowadays, microcontrollers include AD converters fast enough to digitalize signals at frequencies above 77.5 kHz. Using the advantages of undersampling, Goertzel algorithm and correlation techniques, it allows to make program very low computational power demanding. Developed algorithm is supposed to be implemented to 70 MHz ARM7 LPC2103 microcontroller. Examples of code realization in GCC are introduced also with discussion of possible complications.},
