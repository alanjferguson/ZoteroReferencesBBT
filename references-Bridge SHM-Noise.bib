  abstract = {Structural health monitoring ͑SHM͒ is a promising field with widespread application in civil engineering. Structural health monitoring has the potential to make structures safer by observing both long-term structural changes and immediate postdisaster damage. However, the many SHM studies in the literature apply different monitoring methods to different structures, making side-by-side comparison of the methods difficult. This paper details the first phase in a benchmark SHM problem organized under the auspices of the IASC–ASCE Structural Health Monitoring Task Group. The scale-model structure adopted for use in this benchmark problem is described. Then, two analytical models based on the structure—one a 12 degree of freedom ͑DOF͒ shear-building model, the other a 120-DOF model, both finite element based—are given. The damage patterns to be identified are listed as well as the types and number of sensors, magnitude of sensor noise, and so forth. MATLAB computer codes to generate the response data for the various cases are explained. The codes, as well as details of the ongoing Task Group activities, are available on the Task Group web site at ͗http://wusceel.cive.wustl.edu/asce.shm/͘.},

  abstract = {Health monitoring systems set up to assure the safe operation of structures require linking sensors with computational tools able to interpret sensor data in terms of structural performance. Although intensive development continues on innovative sensor systems, there is still considerable uncertainty in deciding on the number of sensors required and their location in order to obtain adequate information on structural behaviour. This paper considers the problem of locating sensors on a bridge structure with the aim of maximizing the data information so that structural dynamic behaviour can be fully characterised. Six different optimal sensor placement techniques, three based on the maximisation of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), one on the properties of the covariance matrix coefficients, and two on energetic approaches, have been investigated. Mode shape displacements were taken as the measured data set and two comparison criteria were employed. The first criterion was based on the mean square error between the FE model and the cubic spline interpolated mode shapes. The second criterion measured the information content of each sensor location to investigate on the strength of the acquired signals and their ability to withstand the noise pollution keeping intact the information relative to the structure properties. The results showed that the effective independence driving-point residue (EFI-DPR) method provides an effective method for optimal sensor placement to identify the vibration characteristics of the studied bridge. The variance method (VM) developed by the authors gave results very close to the EFI-DPR technique, in terms of the capability to capture the vibration mode shape and signal strength. However, the VM presented unique characteristics in the world of the OSP techniques, which is the indication of the optimal number of sensors (ONS).},

  abstract = {Remote structural health monitoring systems employing a sensor-based quantitative assessment of in-service demands and structural condition are perceived as the future in long-term bridge management programs. However, the data analysis techniques and, in particular, the technology conceived years ago that are necessary for accurately and efficiently extracting condition assessment measures from highway infrastructure have just recently begun maturation. In this study, a large-scale wireless sensor network is deployed for ambient vibration testing of a single-span integral abutment bridge to derive in-service modal parameters. Dynamic behavior of the structure from ambient and traffic loads was measured with accelerometers for experimental determination of the natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of the bridge. Real-time data collection from a 40-channel single network operating with a sampling rate of 128~Hz per sensor was achieved with essentially lossless data transmission. Successful acquisition of high-rate, lossless data on the highway bridge validates the proprietary wireless network protocol within an actual service environment. Operational modal analysis is performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the acquisition hardware with additional correlation of the derived modal parameters to a Finite Element Analysis of a model developed using as-built drawings to check plausibility of the mode shapes. Results from this testing demonstrate that wireless sensor technology has matured to the degree that modal analysis of large civil structures with a distributed network is a currently feasible and a comparable alternative to cable-based measurement approaches.},

  abstract = {This study is devoted to the experimental validation of the multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction method for structural health monitoring of long-span suspension bridges. The method for multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction is briefly described. A test bed, comprising of a physical model and an updated finite element (FE) model of a long-span suspension bridge is also concisely introduced. The proposed method is then applied to the test bed; the equation of motion of the test bed subject to ground motion, the objective function for sensor location optimization, the principles for mode selection and multi-type response reconstruction are established. A numerical study using the updated FE model is performed to select the sensor types, numbers, and locations. Subsequently, with the identified sensor locations and some practical considerations, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, laser displacement transducers, and accelerometers are installed on the physical bridge model. Finally, experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the reconstructed responses using the measured responses from the limited number of multi-type sensors agree well with the actual bridge responses. The proposed method is validated to be feasible and effective for the monitoring of structural behavior of long-span suspension bridges.},

  abstract = {Careful selection and placement of sensors are the critical issue in the construction and implementation of an effective structural health monitoring system. A hybrid method termed the optimal sensor placement strategy (OSPS) based on multiple optimization methods is proposed in this paper. The initial sensor placement is firstly obtained by the QR factorization. Then, using the minimization of the off-diagonal elements in the modal assurance criterion matrix as a measure of the utility of a sensor configuration, the quantity of the sensors is determined by the forward and backward sequential sensor placement algorithm together. Finally, the locations of the sensor are determined by the dual-structure coding-based generalized genetic algorithm (GGA). Taking the scientific calculation software matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as a platform, an OSPS toolbox, which is working as a black box, is developed based on the command-line compiling and graphical user interface-aided graphical interface design. The characteristic and operation method of the toolbox are introduced in detail, and the scheme selection of the OSP is carried out on the world's tallest TV tower (Guangzhou New TV Tower) based on the developed toolbox. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective and the software package has a friendly interface, plenty of functions, good expansibility and is easy to operate, which can be easily applied in practical engineering.
