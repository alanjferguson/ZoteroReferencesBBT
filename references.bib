Applications include characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference. In contrast to variation of information, it is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure and thus does not qualify as a statistical metric of spread - it also does not satisfy the triangle inequality. In the simple case, a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 0 indicates that the two distributions in question are identical. In simplified terms, it is a measure of surprise, with diverse applications such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and machine learning.},

In order to acquire a crack position, TOF of the waves reflected from the crack can be estimated from the time domain signal. In this regard, to obtain a crack position with sufficient accuracy, there is a necessity to enhance precision of the measured TOF. First, the original signal is denoised by the wavelet transform smoothed with Savitzky–Golay filtering. Next, to extract appropriate peak, Hilbert Transform is used to construct the signal envelope. After applying peak extraction technique to the signal envelope, the time of the extracted peak has been considered as a TOF. Finally, crack position has been evaluated by calculating group velocities of the propagated waves in each waveguide of the detection system and test pipe.},

  abstract = {Damage detection in civil engineering constructions using the dynamic system parameters has become an important research topic. A direct, fast and inexpensive method is therefore required to evaluate and localize damage using the change in dynamic parameters between the intact and damage states. This paper investigates the application of the change in modal curvatures to detect damage in a prestressed concrete bridge. To establish the method simply supported and continuous beams containing damaged parts at different locations are tested using simulated data. Some important conclusions concerning the computation of the modal curvatures are drawn. A damage indicator called "curvature damage factor" is introduced, in which the difference in curvature mode shape for all modes can be summarized in one number for each measured point. The technique is further applied to a real structure, namely bridge Z24 which lies between the villages Koppigen and Utzenstorf and crosses the highway A1 between Bern and Zurich in Switzerland. In the framework of a Brite-Euram project, the bridge is used as a full-scale specimen and subjected to different damage scenarios in order to introduce damage. © 1999 Academic Press.},

The images are convolved using a difference of Gaussian filterbank. The responses from the filterbank are applied to a precomputed set of principle components. The principle component responses are compared against a Gaussian mixture model of wheels and Gaussian mixture model of non-wheels. Wheel candidates are chosen and tracked. Any wheel tracked in the foreground is chosen as wheel. Initial experimental results along with analysis are included.},

  abstract = {The US Federal Reserve Board has concluded that the failure of civil infrastructure systems to perform at their expected level may reduce the national gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 1\%. Intelligent-infrastructure systems and components hold promise for improving performance with an excellent cost/benefit ratio. A recent National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop demonstrated the state of the art in research and applications on intelligent materials and structures in Japan and the US. Major investments have been made by the leading Japanese construction companies into developments for enabling intelligent-structure applications for mitigating earthquake and wind damage. A number of innovative concepts and ideas have been developed by American researchers; however, a lack of applications has also become apparent. This paper reports on the research of a multidisciplinary team working at the University of Cincinnati Infrastructure Institute to conceptualize a wide spectrum of issues in infrastructure condition assessment, health monitoring and intelligent systems by conducting exploratory research on actual operating highway bridges. The writers have made much progress towards developing an intelligent-bridge application. Such an application requires advances in sensors, communication and information technology, global non-destructive evaluation technologies of a rigorous and objective nature and fundamental knowledge on state parameters, loading environments, damage and deterioration mechanisms and performance of actual highway bridges. The writers initiated a strong university-government-industry partnership a decade ago and have explored a global condition assessment methodology based on the structural identification concept. After a decade, they have reached an in-depth realization of the complex multisystem identification and integration which must accompany any `intelligent' systems approach to the infrastructure problem. The writers are currently maintaining three `typical' steel-stringer highway bridge overpasses as generic test-sites for intelligent structures, condition assessment and health monitoring. One of these bridges, which is forty years old, has been decommissioned. This specimen is being tested to understand damage limit-state behavior. Another ten year old specimen has been tested and monitored for five years to understand operating loading environment and behavior at service limit-states. The third bridge is being monitored during its construction to understand the causes and magnitudes of intrinsic forces. After commissioning, this bridge will have a built-in monitor with 300 embedded/attached sensors, a weigh-in-motion scale and sufficient on-site hardware and software to create an intelligent-bridge prototype. By taking advantage of the linkages provided by research at all three test-sites, it has been possible to understand the complete life-cycle spectrum of loading effects and behavior of the medium length steel-stringer bridge type.},

One way to do this is to use SHM systems and data to provide more accurate, frequent, and realistic live load ratings of a bridge, since the widely accepted load rating is the closest thing a bridge owner has today, to a “health” index of the structure. To address this need, a method has been developed that uses data from SHM systems in combination with conventional load rating equations, to compute continuous rating factors throughout the life of a bridge. The SHM-based ratings take into account slowly varying changes due to thermal effects and deterioration, as well as the actual in-service response due to live loads. The approach is demonstrated on Delaware’s 533-m cable-stayed Indian River Inlet Bridge. Continuous rating factors are computed and reported for periods of time and are compared to the AASHTO LRFR rating factors for the bridge. These rating factors are being used by the Delaware Department of Transportation to both assess the condition of the IRIB and to manage this important structure.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {This study proposes a new damage identification technique for condition assessment of bridge structures. The method is based on the concept of rotation influence line (RIL) at the bridge bearing locations, and solely relies on measurements obtained from two points at either end of the bridge e.g., RILR and RILL. The sensitivity of the rotation measurement to damage is first investigated using a 1-D simply supported beam model and it is demonstrated that unlike conventional strain measurements, the rotation measurement is capable of providing useful information about damage even though it is far from the measurement point. Further, an existing cable-stayed bridge is considered to validate the capability of RIL in damage identification. A comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of the bridge is established and calibrated using the measured static and dynamic responses. Numerous field tests are conducted on this large-scale structure to extract static and dynamic characteristics, including natural frequencies, mode shapes and influence lines (ILs). Sixteen hypothetical damage scenarios are induced in the numerical model, including symmetric and asymmetric cases of cable loss. A damage index based on the normalised discrepancy of RIL between the benchmark state and an unknown state is introduced and through extensive investigations it is demonstrated that regardless of damage location, either RILR or RILL (or both) can successfully identify the induced damage in all of the sixteen damage scenarios. In contrast, the success of strain-based measurement is highly dependent on the closeness of damage to the sensor location, thus a much higher number of strain gauge sensors is required not to misidentify damage. The contribution of this work is four-fold. First, a novel and robust damage identification technique based on RIL is proposed which has not been reported in the literature. Second, the method solely relies on two measurement points e.g., two tilt meters at either end of the bridge and it is capable of identifying damage, even far from the sensor location. Third, the validation of the technique is demonstrated through extensive numerical and field test investigations on a statically indeterminate cable-stayed bridge structure. Finally, it is demonstrated that the conventional strain-based measurement is very likely to misidentify cable damage even with extreme case of cable loss.},

  abstract = {The motivation behind this paper is to develop a spectral-based damage detection and damage localization scheme using in-service ambient vibration in the context of non–model-based damage characterization. In this regard, a response parameter known as spectral moment is implemented for structural damage identification. The damage identification procedure starts with developing response power spectral density (PSD). The principal structural response features are then extracted from the frequency distribution of the spectrum using spectral moments. It is demonstrated that, although, spectral moment is a nonmodal characteristic of a process, it is related to modal parameters of a response signal since the spectral moment at each location is proportional to its corresponding modal vector. Hence, it is expected that due to damage occurrence spectral moment undergoes a variation. On this point, a damage sensitive feature is defined by comparing the spectral moments of two successive states of the structure. It is demonstrated that at a damage location there is a pronounced distinctive change in the indicative feature which is implemented for damage localization. The major advantages of the method include, first, the method works based on output-only measurement data, and second, it does not require any representative model of the structure and finally, unlike modal data that provides information at specific frequencies, the presented method is a broadband approach using information in a wide frequency range. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique was validated by numerical simulations and an experimental case study. A series of numerical simulations with different damage scenarios was carried out on an Euler-Bernoulli beam subject to a band-limited random Gaussian excitation. Damage was simulated by reducing the flexural rigidity of elements at particular locations in single or multiple states. An experimental case study was also investigated utilizing a reinforced concrete jack arch which is one of the major structural components of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Damage was introduced by creating a crack via applying gradual load using load cell. The numerical and experimental analyses indicated a promising sensitivity of the approach to detect and localize structural damage.

Combining large data sets from multiple sources to create a data-driven decision-making framework is crucial for the success of SHM. This paper presents a big data analytics framework that combines multiple data sets correlated with functional relatedness to convert data into actionable information that empowers risk-based decision-making. The integrated data environment incorporates near real-time streams of semi-structured data from remote sensors, historical visual inspection data, and observations from structural analysis models to monitor, assess, and manage risks associated with the aging bridge inventories. Accelerated processing of dataset is made possible by four technologies: cloud computing, relational database processing, support from NOSQL database, and in-memory analytics. The framework is being validated on a railroad corridor that can be subjected to multiple hazards. The framework enables to compute reliability indices for critical bridge components and individual bridge spans. In addition, framework includes a risk-based decision-making process that enumerate costs and consequences of poor bridge performance at span- and network-levels when rail networks are exposed to natural hazard events such as floods and earthquakes.

  abstract = {Experimental and analytical modal analysis techniques have been widely used in civil engineering for a number of years, mostly in seismic applications. Since the beginning of this decade, these techniques have received considerable attention in non-seismic applications such as structural damage detection, analytical model calibration and remote-monitoring systems. In these applications, most studies have concentrated on correlating modal parameters to changes in structural condition. However, for reliable performance of modal techniques in field situations, it is essential to understand and establish the variability of modal parameters due to test procedures and in-service environments of structures. New York has been researching this subject extensively for the past few years, and has tested several structures including (1) a 1/6-scale model highway bridge, (2) an abandoned fracture-critical highway bridge and (3) an in-service highway bridge. Both the abandoned highway bridge and model bridge were tested under intact and simulated-damage conditions. This paper briefly describes these studies. Results indicate that modal frequencies in conjunction with mode shapes may be used to identify the existence of bridge damage or deterioration of interest, but it is difficult to isolate damage locations using these modal parameters. Operating conditions affect the modal properties and are critical in establishing a baseline for structural monitoring.},

  abstract = {Development of fatigue cracking is affecting the structural performance of many of welded steel bridges in the United States. One of the main sources of fatigue cracking is out-of-plane distortion occurring at connections of transverse structural members and longitudinal girders. Distortion-induced fatigue cracks mostly occur in older bridges with members prone to fatigue. Prediction of secondary stresses in these members is difficult using conventional design specifications. This limitation suggests the necessity of utilizing new strategies to analyze the damage caused by distortion-related cracking. This study presents a new approach for detection of distortion-induced fatigue cracking of steel bridges based on the interpretation of the data provided by a newly developed self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) sensor. The PFG sensors are empowered using piezoelectric transducers through harvesting energy from the mechanical loading experienced by the structure. In order to assess the performance of the proposed sensing system, three-dimensional finite element models were developed and the structural response of the girder was subsequently obtained. The fatigue life of the girder was determined based on J-integral concept and Paris Law. Several damage states were defined by extending the fatigue crack lengths. Thereafter, features representing the PFG sensor output were extracted from the strain data for different sensing nodes to detect the damage scenarios. Furthermore, a new data fusion concept based on the effect of group of sensors was proposed to improve the damage detection performance. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of detecting different damage progression states. This is specifically evident for the sensors that are located close to the damage location. The acceptable performance of the proposed sensing system implies its applicability for other modalities of infrastructure/structural health monitoring (I/SHM). © 2016},

  abstract = {Energy conservation techniques for wireless sensor networks generally assume that data acquisition and processing have energy consumption that is significantly lower than that of communication. Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in a number of practical applications, where sensors may consume even more energy than the radio. In this context, effective energy management should include policies for an efficient utilization of the sensors, which become one of the main components that affect the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that estimates online the optimal sampling frequencies for sensors. This approach, which requires the design of adaptive measurement systems, minimizes the energy consumption of the sensors and, incidentally, that of the radio while maintaining a very high accuracy of collected data. As a case study, we considered a sensor for snow-monitoring applications. Simulation experiments have shown that the suggested adaptive algorithm can reduce the number of acquired samples up to 79\% with respect to a traditional fixed-rate approach. We have also found that it can perform similar to a fixed-rate scheme where the sampling frequency is known in advance.},

The 62 m long two-lane bridge was to be replaced by a newer construction designed for higher traffic loads and was thus available for in-situ trials once it had been closed to traffic. The monitoring started in February 2016 to observe the three-span structure in its original state when excited by ambient and vehicle-induced vibrations. Initial construction works around the sloping abutment and the pier foundations, such as pile driving and extension of the embankment, started at the end of March, followed by the closure to traffic and the removal of the asphalt pavement. Over the next few weeks, the bridge saw three damage scenarios induced in the following order: 1. Six out of sixteen tension cables were severed above one of the piers; 2. Expansive mortar was filled into boreholes in the deck; 3. Expansive mortar was filled into boreholes in one of the piers to induce cracking. The bridge was equipped with accelerometers, inclination sensors and fibre-optic strain gauges that continuously monitored the structure’s condition. For safety reasons, the sensors in direct vicinity of the damage points were gradually moved to other parts of the bridge or dismantled completely in the course of the damage infliction. The aim of the monitoring was to assess the detectability of the structural weakening using a variety of measurement techniques and to see what role data quality, sensor positioning and auxiliary information plays in reliably diagnosing the extent of the damage or defining an alarm level. Different ways of post-processing the data were examined to see what information can be gained without having to create a numerical model of the structure when insufficient design documents are available.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Aiming to provide more efficient, lightweight structures, composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace vehicles. As the failure mechanisms of these materials are complex, damage detection becomes challenging, requiring advanced techniques for assessing structural integrity and maintaining aircraft safety. In this context, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) seeks for integrating sensors into the structures in a way that Nondestructive Testing (NDT) is implemented continuously. One promising approach is to use Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS) to acquire strain signals, taking advantages of their capabilities over conventional sensors. Despite several works have developed Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) using FOS for performing in-flight SHM in aircraft structures, automatic damage detection using the acquired signals has not been achieved in a robust way against environmental and operational variability, in all flight stages or considering different types of damages. In this work, a HUMS was developed and implemented in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on 20 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) embedded into the composite front spar of the aircraft's wing, a miniaturized data acquisition subsystem for gathering strain signals and a wireless transmission subsystem for remote sensing. The HUMS was tested in 16 flights, six of them were carried out with the pristine structure and the remaining after inducing different artificial damages. The in-flight data were used to validate a previously developed damage detection methodology based on strain field pattern recognition, or strain mapping, which utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based procedure for clustering operational conditions and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with damage indices for final classification. The performance of the damage detection demonstrated a highest accuracy of 0.981 and a highest {$<$}math{$>$}F1{$<$}/math{$>$} score of 0.978.

  abstract = {In the last years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained increasing attention from both the research community and actual users. As sensor nodes are generally battery-powered devices, the critical aspects to face concern how to reduce the energy consumption of nodes, so that the network lifetime can be extended to reasonable times. In this paper we first break down the energy consumption for the components of a typical sensor node, and discuss the main directions to energy conservation in WSNs. Then, we present a systematic and comprehensive taxonomy of the energy conservation schemes, which are subsequently discussed in depth. Special attention has been devoted to promising solutions which have not yet obtained a wide attention in the literature, such as techniques for energy efficient data acquisition. Finally we conclude the paper with insights for research directions about energy conservation in WSNs.},

  abstract = {Vibration-based structural health monitoring of civil structures relies on the repeated identification of dynamic structural characteristics of the structure from output-only vibration data. Natural frequencies and displacement mode shapes are the most commonly employed dynamic characteristics; yet their sensitivity to local damage of moderate severity is rather low with respect to their sensitivity to other factors such as temperature, necessitating data normalization. Strain mode shapes offer a higher sensitivity to local damage, but their accurate identification in a dense grid is challenging given the very small dynamic strain levels that are encountered under ambient excitation. In this article, a method is presented for tackling this challenge. It consists of three stages. First, fiber-optic Bragg grating strain sensors are attached to the structure and interrogated with a tunable laser performing a wavelength sweep. In this way, the measured strain amplitudes have the required accuracy but synchronization errors are introduced between the different Bragg sensors. Second, a modal analysis is performed on the dynamic strain data using an accurate parametric system identification technique. This is followed by a synchronization step which compensates for the delays introduced by the wavelength sweep. Finally, the synchronized strain mode shapes are employed as damage-sensitive features, either directly or via a newly proposed quantity, the top-to-bottom strain ratio. The method is validated by progressive damage testing of a complex, prestressed concrete “roof” beam, reinforced with steel fibers. It is observed that the proposed method can identify both the presence and the location of the damage in a relatively early stage. © The Author(s) 2017.},

It leverages sensor technology, cutting edge communication and data analytics technologies and the open Internet to consolidate IT and operational technology (OT) aiming to achieve cost and performance benefits. However, the underlying resource constraints and ad hoc nature of such systems have significant implications especially in achieving effective intrusion detection. Consequently, contemporary solutions requiring a stable infrastructure and extensive computational resources are inadequate to fulfill these characteristics of an IIoT system. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection framework for the energy-constrained IoT devices which form the foundation of an IIoT ecosystem. In view of the ad hoc nature of such systems as well as emerging complex threats such as botnets, we assess the feasibility of collaboration between the host (IoT devices) and the edge devices for effective intrusion detection whilst minimizing energy consumption and communication overhead. We implemented the proposed framework with Contiki operating system and conducted rigorous evaluation to identify potential performance trade-offs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can minimize energy and communication overheads whilst achieving an effective collaborative intrusion detection for IIoT systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This study introduces a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based approach for structural health monitoring (SHM) that exploits a form of measured compressed response data through transfer learning (TL)‐based techniques. The implementation of the proposed methodology allows damage identification and localization within a realistic large‐scale system. To validate the proposed method, first, a well‐known benchmark model is numerically simulated. Using acceleration response histories, as well as compressed response data in terms of discrete histograms, CNN models are trained, and the robustness of the CNN architectures is evaluated. Finally, pretrained CNNs are fine‐tuned to be adaptable for three‐parameter, extremely compressed response data, based on the response mean, standard deviation, and a scale factor. The performance of each CNN implementation is assessed using training accuracy histories as well as confusion matrices, along with other performance metrics. In addition to the numerical study, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using experimental vibration response data for verification and validation. The results indicate that deep TL can be implemented effectively for SHM of similar structural systems with different types of sensors.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Large vehicles have a major impact on traffic flow, as well as road maintenance. Information about passenger car versus truck volume is crucial for all transportation agencies. The work presented here provides a comprehensive method to develop length-based vehicle classification (LBVC) techniques that could be implemented using inductive loops (IDL) or magnetometer sensors (MAG). Distinctive LBVC schemes were developed to bin vehicles into groups based on structural similarity and statistical characteristics. Data collection, including vehicle magnetic length (VML) estimates using IDL and MAG, was performed at different sites located on Oklahoma highways and rural roadways to capture various traffic characteristics. Video images were utilized as ground-truth for accurate data labeling. Extensive data analyses, including machine learning methods and probabilistic modeling, were conducted to define decision boundaries for developed LBVC schemes. Three scenarios were developed for determining optimal thresholding methods: total classification accuracy maximization, per-group classification error minimization, and equal classification error optimization. Evaluation revealed consistent and accurate performance for all developed schemes. Classification accuracies of 97.70\% and 99.00\% were reported using MAG and IDL, respectively. The developed classification models are computationally efficient and can provide real-time LBVC data. The models are intended to supplement or replace axle-based data collection methods used throughout Oklahoma. The methodology developed in this work will also benefit other states and territories interested in developing LBVC schemes.},

In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to ‘lock-in’ to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from ‘big data’ analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others.},

Data will be collected through live-load and dynamic testing, physical material testing, detailed inspections, NDT/NDE, and long-term structural health monitoring. As part of the pilot phase of the overall program, seven bridges across the United States have been tested and are in various stages of being instrumented for long-term structural health monitoring. This paper focuses on a two-span, post-tensioned, box girder bridge located near Sacramento, California, which is one of the initial pilot bridges. The initial live-load and dynamic testing, physical material testing, detailed visual inspection, and an NDE deck scan have already been performed to establish the baseline bridge condition for future comparisons. Long-term instrumentation including strain gauges, velocity transducers, tiltmeters, vibrating wire strain gauges, thermocouples, and a real time camera have been installed. Once long-term bridge behavior is understood, maintenance decision tools can be developed that will aid bridge owners and administrators in better practice management.

The deck structure of the bridge consists of a slab and three simply supported beams. The damage is represented by a series of notches made on a lateral beam to simulate the effect of incremental concentrated damage. The variation of natural frequencies shows an anomalous increase in the transition from one intermediate configuration to the next damage configurations. Vibration modes shapes show an appreciable asymmetry, despite the nominal symmetry of the reference configuration of the bridge. A justification of this unexpected dynamic behavior is presented in this paper. The analysis is based on progressive identification of an accurate finite element model of the reference and damage configurations based on natural frequency and vibration modes measurement. Finally, changes in modal curvature of the first two modes evaluated along the main beams were successfully used to identify the location of the damage.},

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are implemented for structures (e.g., bridges, buildings) to monitor their operations and health status. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming an enabling technology for SHM applications that are more prevalent and more easily deployable than traditional wired networks. However, SHM brings new challenges to WSNs: engineering-driven optimal deployment, a large volume of data, sophisticated computing, and so forth. In this paper, we address two important challenges: sensor deployment and decentralized computing. We propose a solution, to deploy wireless sensors at strategic locations to achieve the best estimates of structural health (e.g., damage) by following the widely used wired sensor system deployment approach from civil/structural engineering. We found that faults (caused by communication errors, unstable connectivity, sensor faults, etc.) in such a deployed WSN greatly affect the performance of SHM. To make the WSN resilient to the faults, we present an approach, called FTSHM (fault-tolerance in SHM), to repair the WSN and guarantee a specified degree of fault tolerance. FTSHM searches the repairing points in clusters in a distributed manner, and places a set of backup sensors at those points in such a way that still satisfies the engineering requirements. FTSHM also includes an SHM algorithm suitable for decentralized computing in the energy-constrained WSN, with the objective of guaranteeing that the WSN for SHM remains connected in the event of a fault, thus prolonging the WSN lifetime under connectivity and data delivery constraints. We demonstrate the advantages of FTSHM through extensive simulations and real experimental settings on a physical structure. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a monitoring application with a wireless sensor network that was performed on a 95 years old riveted steel railway bridge. In order to perform an accurate assessment, strains were monitored on critical elements to catch the real loading during the passage of heavy freight trains. The wireless sensor network deployed on the bridge consisted of 8 nodes supplied with resistance strain gages and the root node connected to a solar energy rechargeable, battery powered base station. The monitoring system was operated in event-based mode to achieve an energy efficient operation to prolong the lifetime of the sensor network. The event detection was carried out with ultra low power MEMS acceleration sensors, which measured continuously the accelerations of the bridge and detected an approaching train. If this occurred, the sensor generated an interrupt that immediately switched on the strain gage's conditioning board and starts the measurement. Switching on the conditioning board shortly before starting the measurement, however, produces biased raw data because the strain gage was still heating up due to the current flow. Instead of eliminating the time-dependent bias by adding a dummy gage to the Wheatstone bridge, the bias was removed by post-processing the raw data. The paper demonstrates that this procedure provides sufficiently accurate input data for use in cycle counting based fatigue assessment of steel bridges.},

  abstract = {With growing complex infrastructure, autonomous condition assessment of large-scale structures has garnered significant attention over the past few decades. Data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques offer valuable information of existing health of the structures, maintain the safety and their uninterrupted use under varied operational conditions by undertaking timely risk and hazard mitigation. Traditional approaches, however, are not enough to monitor a large amount of SHM data and conduct systematic decision making for future maintenance. In this article, building information modeling (BIM) is utilised as a promising computing environment and integrated digital representation platform of SHM that can organize and visualise a considerable amount of sensor data and subsequent structural health information over a prolonged period. A BIM-enabled platform is utilised to develop the proposed visualisation tool for a long-span bridge and enable automated sensor data inventory into the BIM environment. Such automated tool facilitates systematic maintenance and risk management, while avoiding manual errors resulting from visual inspection of the structures. The proposed method can be considered as a user-friendly and economic framework for condition assessment and disaster mitigation of structures from long-term monitored data.}

  abstract = {The recent rapid development of rotation rate sensor technology opens new opportunities for their application in more and more fields. In this paper, the potential of rotational sensors for the modal analysis of full-scale civil engineering structural elements is experimentally examined. For this purpose, vibrations of two 6-m long beams made of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) were measured using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) rotation rate sensors. The beams were excited to vibrations using an impact hammer and a dynamic vibration exciter. The results of the experiment show that by using rotation rate sensors, one can directly obtain derivatives of mode shapes and deflection shapes. These derivatives of mode shapes, often called “rotational modes”, bring more information regarding possible local stiffness variations than the traditional transversal and deflection mode shapes, so their extraction during structural health monitoring is particularly useful. Previously, the rotational modes could only be obtained indirectly (e.g., by central difference approximation). Here, with the application of rotation rate sensors, one can obtain rotational modes and deflection shapes with a higher precision. Furthermore, the average strain rate and dynamic strain were acquired using the rotation rate sensors. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that rotation rate sensors were matured enough to be used in the monitoring and modal analyses of full-scale civil engineering elements (e.g., reinforced concrete beams).},

  abstract = {An ambient vibration survey of the Humber Bridge was carried out in July 2008 by a combined team from the UK, Portugal and Hong Kong. The exercise had several purposes that included the evaluation of the current technology for instrumentation and system identification and the generation of an experimental dataset of modal properties to be used for validation and updating of finite element models for scenario simulation and structural health monitoring. The exercise was conducted as part of a project aimed at developing online diagnosis capabilities for three landmark European suspension bridges.Ten stand-alone tri-axial acceleration recorders were deployed at locations along all three spans and in all four pylons during five days of consecutive one-hour recordings. Time series segments from the recorders were merged, and several operational modal analysis techniques were used to analyse these data and assemble modal models representing the global behaviour of the bridge in all three dimensions for all components of the structure.The paper describes the equipment and procedures used for the exercise, compares the operational modal analysis (OMA) technology used for system identification and presents modal parameters for key vibration modes of the complete structure.The results obtained using three techniques, natural excitation technique/eigensystem realisation algorithm, stochastic subspace identification and poly-Least Squares Frequency Domain method, are compared among themselves and with those obtained from a 1985 test of the bridge, showing few significant modal parameter changes over 23 years in cases where direct comparison is possible.The measurement system and the much more sophisticated OMA technology used in the present test show clear advantages necessary due to the compressed timescales compared to the earlier exercise. Even so, the parameter estimates exhibit significant variability between different methods and variations of the same method, while also varying in time and having inherent variability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It seems that, quite apart from extreme man-made or natural hazards, our transportation infrastructure is not resilient under man-made or natural loads, and we need to leverage technology to better understand and respond to societal risks due to a lack of resiliency. The challenge to improve infrastructure resilience has led to major infrastructure research initiatives that are relevant to the case of bridges. FHWA created the Long Term Bridge Performance Program, while in the UK, EPSRC recently promoted the two themes of resilient infrastructure and monitoring and field investigation of existing infrastructure. The paper will describe these initiatives and how they aim to improve the resilience of bridges, which are key components in our transport infrastructure. It will also suggest some specific activities for developing closer interactions between a wide range of academic and industry stakeholders leading to development effective decision support methodologies. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {Long-span bridges deform quasi-statically and dynamically under a range of operational conditions including wind, traffic and thermal loads, in varying patterns, at different timescales and with different amplitudes. While external loads and internal forces can only rarely be measured, there are well-developed technologies for measuring deformations and their time and space derivatives. Performance data can be checked against design limits and used for validating conceptual and numerical models which can in turn be used to estimate the external loads and internal forces. Changes in performance patterns and load–response relationships can also be used directly as a diagnostic tool, but excessive deformations themselves are also a concern in terms of serviceability. This paper describes application of a range of measurement technologies, focusing on response to extreme loads, for suspension bridges over the River Tamar (with 335~m main span) and Humber (with 1410~m man span). The effects of vehicular, thermal and wind loads on these very different structures are compared, showing that apart from rare extreme traffic and wind loads, temporal and spatial temperature variations dominate quasi-static response. Observations of deformation data and sensor performance for the two bridges are used to highlight limitations and redundancies in the instrumentation. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

The technique is based on the input provided by two WIM systems: (1) a pavement-based WIM station located in the same route as the bridge (which gives vehicle weight estimates without the influence of the bridge), and (2) a bridge-based WIM (B-WIM) system that estimates vehicle weights based on the deformation of the bridge. The authors show that the ratio of estimations of vehicle weights by both systems is a reliable and robust indicator of structural integrity, even for WIM systems with relatively poor accuracy. They further show that this indicator is more sensitive to damage than the traditional method based on variation in natural frequencies. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {This paper reports an experimental campaign that aims at measuring the evolution of bridge modal properties during the passage of a vehicle. It investigates not only frequency shifts due to various vehicle positions, but also changes in the shape of the modes of vibration. Two different bridges were instrumented and loaded by traversing trucks or trucks momentarily stationed on the bridge. The measurements were analysed by means of an output-only technique and a novel use of the continuous wavelet transform, which is presented here for the first time. The analysis reveals the presence of additional frequencies, significant shifts in frequencies and changes in the modes of vibration. These phenomena are theoretically investigated with the support of a simplified numerical model. This paper offers an interpretation of vehicle-bridge interaction of two particular case studies. The results clearly show that the modal properties of the vehicle and bridge do change with varying vehicle position.},

  abstract = {The natural frequencies of coupled vehicle-bridge systems change with vehicle position. These changes are generally attributed to the contribution of the additional mass of the vehicle. However, other mechanical properties of the vehicle influence the evolution of the vehicle-bridge system frequencies, an aspect that has rarely been addressed. The aim of this paper is to further explore how frequencies vary during a vehicle passage and empirically show that the frequency shift depends also on the vehicle-to-bridge frequency ratio. The responses of a scaled model of a vehicle traversing a bridge are measured and analysed. The signals are processed in the time-frequency domain to assess the non-stationary and non-linear nature of the responses. The interpretation is supported with the predictions of a coupled vehicle and bridge numerical model. The results confirm different frequency shifts for vehicles with the same mass but different suspension properties. Furthermore, the direct (sensor on bridge) and indirect (sensor on vehicle) methods of extracting the bridge fundamental frequency are compared. The implications of these findings for indirect or drive-by bridge monitoring techniques are discussed.},

This paper is an extension to the work presented at International Conference on Intelligent Manufacturing and Internet of Things. The additional material includes a detailed focus on feature selection and the various approaches for identifying important features in the data, an updated framework methodology and description, an extension of XGBoost to allow this model to be used for prediction/classification and a comparison for classification with a Random Forest, tree-based model.

A statistical classification algorithm is presented here which is based on analysis of a structure's response in the time domain. The time-series responses are fitted with Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models and the ARMA coefficients are fed to the classifier. The classifier is capable of learning in an unsupervised manner and of forming new classes when the structural response exhibits change. The approach is demonstrated with experimental data from the IASC-ASCE benchmark four-storey frame structure, the Z24 bridge and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link bridge. The classifier is found to be capable of identifying structural change in all cases and of forming distinct classes corresponding to different structural states in most cases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel methodology for structural health monitoring of a bridge is presented with implementations for bridge load rating using sensor and video image data from operating traffic. With this methodology, video images are analyzed by means of computer vision techniques to detect and track vehicles crossing the bridge. Traditional sensor data are correlated with computer images to extract unit influence lines (UILs). Based on laboratory studies, UILs can be extracted for a critical section with different vehicles by means of synchronized video and sensor data. The synchronized computer vision and strain measurements can be obtained for bridge load rating under operational traffic. For this, the following are presented: a real life bridge is instrumented and monitored, and the real-life data are processed under a moving load. A detailed finite-element model (FEM) of the bridge is also developed and presented along with the experimental measurements to support the applicability of the approach for load rating using UILs extracted from operating traffic. The load rating of the bridges using operational traffic in real life was validated with the FEM results of the bridge and the simulation of the operational traffic on the bridge. This approach is further proven with different vehicles captured with video and measurements. The UILs are used for load rating by multiplying the UIL vector of the critical section with the load vector from the HL-93 design truck. The load rating based on the UIL is compared with the FEM results and indicates good agreement. With this method, it is possible to extract UILs of bridges under regular traffic and obtain load rating efficiently.

  abstract = {Developed economies depend on complex and extensive systems of infrastructure to maintain economic prosperity and quality of life. In recent years, the implementation of Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems on full-scale bridges has increased. The goal of these systems is to inform owners of the condition of structures, thereby supporting surveillance, maintenance and other management tasks. Data-driven methods, that involve tracking changes in signals only, are well-suited for analyzing measurements during continuous monitoring of structures. Also, information provided by the response of structures under moving loads is useful for condition assessment. This paper discusses the application of data-driven methods on moving-load responses in order to detect the occurrence and the location of damage. First, an approach for using moving-load responses as time series data is proposed. The work focuses on two data-driven methods - Moving principal component analysis (MPCA) and Robust regression analysis (RRA) - that have already been successful for damage detection during continuous monitoring. The performance of each method is assessed using data obtained by simulating the crossing of a point-load on a simple frame. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this context a load test and an environmental test were carried out aiming at the assessment of the new structural condition and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the elements' strengthening. A structural analysis was carried out in order to characterize the most relevant aspects of the structural behavior and to support the discussion of the field results. Particular aspects concerning the main girders' bending, the nature of nodes' rotations, and the response under temperature changes are highlighted. The effectiveness of the strengthening of the top chords is verified based on the strains' measurements. Finally, it is shown that the thorough characterization of the structural behavior enabled the establishment of a reference condition for future assessments of the structure.},

In addition, the rapid development of fiber-optic sensors, particularly the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors offers many advantages and capability that could not be achieved otherwise. In the past few years, fiber Bragg grating sensors have attracted a lot of interest and they are being used in numerous applications. This paper describes the FBG sensors developed for structural health monitoring, and were installed on Hong Kong's landmark Tsing Ma bridge (TMB), which is the world longest (1377 m) suspension bridge that carried both railway and regular road traffic. Forty FBG sensors divided into three arrays were installed on the hanger cable, rocker bearing and truss girders of the TMB. The objectives of the study are to investigate the feasibility of using the developed FBG sensors for structural health monitoring, via monitoring the strain of different parts of the TMB under both the railway and highway loads as well as comparing the FBG sensors' performance with the conventional structural health monitoring system - Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) that has been operating at TMB since the bridge's commissioning in May 1997. The experimental observations in this project show that the results using FBG sensors were in excellent agreement with those acquired by WASHMS. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Today, these tasks are done by visual inspection and very traditional methods such as the tap test.

Structural health monitoring techniques based on changes in dynamic characteristics have been studied for the last three decades. When the damage is substantial, these methods have some success in determining if damage has occurred. At incipient stages of damage, however, the existing methods are not as successful. A number of new research projects have been funded to improve the damage detection methods including the use of innovative signal processing, new sensors, and control theory.

A key bottleneck is that most data comparison algorithms today rely on a human expert to specify what ‘features' of the data are relevant for comparison. Here, we propose a new principle for estimating the similarity between the sources of arbitrary data streams, using neither domain knowledge nor learning. We demonstrate the application of this principle to the analysis of data from a number of real-world challenging problems, including the disambiguation of electro-encephalograph patterns pertaining to epileptic seizures, detection of anomalous cardiac activity from heart sound recordings and classification of astronomical objects from raw photometry. In all these cases and without access to any domain knowledge, we demonstrate performance on a par with the accuracy achieved by specialized algorithms and heuristics devised by domain experts. We suggest that data smashing principles may open the door to understanding increasingly complex observations, especially when experts do not know what to look for.},

The integrated SENSKIN technology will be implemented in the case of steel and concrete bridges, and tested, field-evaluated and benchmarked on actual bridge environment against a conventional health monitoring solution developed by Mistras Group Hellas. The main objective of the present work is to implement the autonomous, fully functional strain monitoring system based on commercially available off-the-shelf components, that will be used to accomplish direct comparison between the performance of the innovative SENSKIN sensors and the conventional strain sensors commonly used for structural monitoring of bridges. For this purpose, the mini Structural Monitoring System (mini SMS) of Physical Acoustics Corporation, a comprehensive data acquisition unit designed specifically for long-term unattended operation in outdoor environments, was selected. For the completion of the conventional system, appropriate foil-type strain sensors were selected, driven by special conditioners manufactured by Mistras Group. A comprehensive description of the strain monitoring system and its peripheral components is provided in this paper. For the evaluation of the integrated system’s performance and the effect of various parameters on the long-term behavior of sensors, several test steel pieces instrumented with different strain sensors configurations were prepared and tested in both laboratory and field ambient conditions. Furthermore, loading tests were performed aiming to validate the response of the system in monitoring the strains developed in steel beam elements subject to bending regimes.

To validate the framework and algorithms developed, it has conducted a series of bench tests with computational experiments. The simulated numerical results/plots are consistent with the analytically derived results in terms of the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In structural health monitoring (SHM), revealing the underlying correlations of monitoring data is of considerable significance, both theoretically and practically. In contrast to the traditional correlation analysis for numerical data, this study seeks to analyse the correlation of probability distributions of inter-sensor monitoring data. Due to induced by some commonly shared random excitations, many structural responses measured at different locations are usually correlated in distributions. Clarifying and quantifying such distributional correlations not only enables a more comprehensive understanding of the essential dependence properties of SHM data, but also has appealing application values; however, statistical methods pertinent to this topic are rare. To this end, this article proposes a novel approach using functional data analysis techniques. The monitoring data collected by each sensor are divided into time segments and later summarized by the corresponding probability density functions (PDFs). The geometric relations of the PDFs in terms of their shape mappings between sensors are first characterized by warping functions, and they are subsequently decomposed into finite functional principal components (FPCs); one FPC of the warping functions characterizes one deformation pattern in the transformation of the shapes of the PDFs from one sensor to another. Using this principle, the inter-sensor geometric correlation patterns of PDFs can be clarified by analysing the correlation of the FPC scores of warping functions to the PDFs from one sensor. To overcome the challenge of correlation quantification for real-valued samples (FPC scores) coupled with their functional counterparts (PDFs), a novel nonparametric functional regression (NFR)-based correlation coefficient is defined. Both simulation and real data studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed method.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Identification of spatio-temporal distribution of vehicle loads is very important for understanding the exact loading conditions and behaviors of long-span bridges. Using computer vision technology combining the monitoring information of the weigh-in-motion system (WIM) at one cross-section and the camera along the bridge, a method to identify the spatio-temporal distribution of vehicle loads for long-span bridges is proposed. For moving vehicles, template images were sampled from the camera video at the location of the WIM, and the weight information of the captured vehicle was extracted from the output data sheet of the WIM based on the relationship of the pass time. Template matching and particle filter techniques were used to track the moving vehicle loads on the bridge. The images were processed using the computer vision technology. The video images obtained from cameras and the weight information measured by the WIM on the Hangzhou Bay Bridge were employed in this study. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm were validated through the in situ field test results on the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In long-term health monitoring of bridge structures, system identification is often performed based only on the system output (bridge vibration response) because the system input (traffic excitation) is difficult to measure. To facilitate the identification of the bridgeproperties, traffic excitation is commonly modeled as spatially uncorrelated white noise. A physical model of a stationary stream of vehicles (moving loads) arriving in accordance with a Poisson process, traversing an elstic beam, shows that the traffic excitation is spatially correlated. Employing the dynamic nodal loading approach, this spatial correlation results in a frequency-dependent excitation spectrum density matrix, and shifts the response spectra obtained from those excited by spatially uncorrelated white noise. It is shown that the application of system identification techniques based on the conventional excitation model may result in misleading structural properties. Hence, this study further proposes an output-only gray-box identification technique for bridge structures, in which knowledge about nature of the traffic excitation, such as its spatial correlation, is implanted into an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model. The identifiability of the ARMA model so constructed is assured and the feasibility of the proposed identification technique is demonstrated by a numerical example. © 2005 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

  abstract = {Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S\&T) is leading a ten-partner, five-year University Transportation Center with a theme of “Inspecting and Preserving Infrastructure through Robotic Exploration (INSPIRE).” The goal of the INSPIRE Center is to transform in representative demonstration cases the current labor-intensive, inconsistent, and expensive ad hoc process of bridge inspection and maintenance into an efficient, safe, reliable, and cost-effective data-driven decision-making protocol. In this presentation, the needs for an autonomous bridge inspection and maintenance program are first established. A framework of such a program integrating sensor measurement, nondestructive evaluation (NDE), and data analytics into visual inspection through a mobile platform of robotics is then envisioned to improve the reliability of inspection data and results, streamline the inspection and maintenance process, and augment the inspection of fracture critical members. Next, key to the success of the program, structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies such as lab-on-sensor innovation for the understanding of structural behaviors, microwave imaging for the internal condition monitoring of bridge structures, and adaptive wavelet transform for the extraction of damage and deterioration from images are introduced. Finally, industry-university collaborations, which is critical to realizing the envisioned integrating framework, are dicussed and the potential SHM impacts to bridge preservation are identified. In general, a global lab-on-sensor system is key to quantifying structural behaviors and, together with local NDEs, enables both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the condition of bridge systems or even transportation networks. The bridge condition identified during inspection can be used to prioritize the maintenance of bridges. An unmanned aerial vehicle with one or two remotely-controlled arms can potentially make bridge inspection and maintenance an integrated task. The autonomous inspection and maintenance program likely results in cheaper, faster, and more reliable solutions in bridge preservation. © 2017 International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastrucure.

Message-passing protocols, such as FTSP, introduce different sets of compromises and constraints. In this paper, we present an inexpensive and ultra-low power ({$<$}; 100 μA) mote peripheral, we term the Universal Time Signal Receiver, that leverages the availability of time signals transmitted by dedicated radio stations around the globe to provide access to UTC time with millisecond-level accuracy. We present experimental results measuring signal availability, quality of synchronization across motes, and power consumption. We show that the proposed universal time signal receiver achieves global time synchronization and for applications where millisecond-level precision is sufficient, it consumes up to 1,000 times less energy than GPS or FTSP.},

  abstract = {Structural condition assessment of highway bridges is traditionally performed by visual inspections or nondestructive evaluation techniques, which are either slow, unreliable or detects only local flaws. Instrumentation of bridges with accelerometers and other sensors, however, can provide real-time data useful for monitoring the global structural conditions of the bridges due to ambient and forced excitations. This paper reports a video-assisted approach for structural health monitoring of highway bridges, with results from field tests and subsequent offline parameter identification. The field tests were performed on a short-span instrumented bridge. Videos of vehicles passing by were captured, synchronized with data recordings from the accelerometers. For short-span highway bridges, vibration is predominantly due to traffic excitation. A stochastic model of traffic excitation on bridges is developed assuming that vehicles traversing a bridge (modeled as an elastic beam) form a sequence of Poisson process moving loads and that the contact force of a vehicle on the bridge deck can be converted to equivalent dynamic loads at the nodes of the beam elements. Basic information of vehicle types, arrival times and speeds are extracted from video images to develop a physics-based simulation model of the traffic excitation. This modeling approach aims at circumventing a difficulty in the system identification of bridge structural parameters. Current practice of system identification of bridge parameters is often based on the measured response (or system output) only, and knowledge of the input (traffic excitation) is either unknown or assumed, making it difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the state of the bridge structures. Our model reveals that traffic excitation on bridges is spatially correlated, an important feature that is usually incorrectly ignored in most output-only methods. A recursive Bayesian filtering is formulated to monitor the evolution of the state of the bridge. The effectiveness and viability of this video-assisted approach are demonstrated by the field results.},

  abstract = {Wireless magnetic sensor networks offer an attractive, low-cost alternative to inductive loops for traffic measurement in freeways and at intersections. In addition to providing vehicle count, occupancy, and speed, these sensors yield information (such as non-axle-based vehicle classification) that cannot be obtained from standard loop data. Because such networks can be deployed quickly, they can be used (and reused) for temporary traffic measurement. This paper reports the detection capabilities of magnetic sensors on the basis of two field experiments. The first experiment collected a 2-h trace of measurements on Hearst Avenue in Berkeley, California. The vehicle detection rate was better than 99\% (100\% for vehicles other than motorcycles), and estimates of average vehicle length and speed appear to have been better than 90\%. The measurements also yield intervehicle spacing or headways, revealing interesting phenomena such as platoon formation downstream of a traffic signal. Results of the second experiment are preliminary. Sensor data from 37 passing vehicles at the same site are processed and classified into six types. Sixty percent of the vehicles are classified correctly when length is not used as a feature. The classification algorithm can be implemented in real time by the sensor node itself, in contrast to other methods based on high-scan-rate inductive loop signals, which require extensive off-line computation. It is believed that if length were used as a feature, 80\% to 90\% of vehicles would be correctly classified.},

The current work introduces the concept of cointegration, a tool for the analysis of non-stationary time series, as a promising new approach for dealing with the problem of environmental variation in monitored features. If two or more monitored variables from an SHM system are cointegrated, then some linear combination of them will be a stationary residual purged of the common trends in the original dataset. The stationary residual created from the cointegration procedure can be used as a damage-sensitive feature that is independent of the normal environmental and operational conditions.},

The application of cointegration is a new idea for SHM from the field of econometrics, and this is the first work in which it has been comprehensively applied to an SHM problem. Results when applying cointegration are compared with results from the more familiar outlier analysis and an approach that uses minor principal components. The ability of these methods for removing the effects of environmental/operational variations from damage-sensitive features is demonstrated and compared with benchmark data from the Brite-Euram project DAMASCOS (BE97 4213), which was collected from a Lamb-wave inspection of a composite panel subject to temperature variations in an environmental chamber.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the monitoring of any type of structure for the express purpose of determining its condition and future lifespan and if, when and where any reparative action is needed. A focus of the work in this thesis is SHM for long-span bridges and particularly the effects of environmental and operational conditions on a monitoring campaign. There is currently a trend for heavily instrumenting civil structures with large sensor networks that continually collect terabytes of data. However, these large data sets are often redundantly stored and not used for anything. One of the principal aims in the thesis is to exploit such monitoring data for the development of diagnostic tools for structural condition assessment. The first part of the thesis concerns formulating a baseline for the Tamar Bridge that represents the normal undamaged condition of the structure. To do this a large amount of analysis was needed in order to understand how different structural measurements are interrelated and how the bridge responds to normal environmental and operational conditions. Particular attention was paid to measurements that can be sensitive to structural degradation (such as modal properties). Often simple causal relationships were found between monitored variables, and response surface models were formulated that could predict selected variables with good accuracy given measurement of operational and environmental conditions, such as air temperature, traffic loading and wind profile. The predictive models developed are intended to be used as diagnostic tools, for example, a departure from the normal condition of the bridge will bring about a significant increase in prediction error, which may be monitored as a system alarm. The second part of the thesis directly concerns how the influence of environmental and operational variation on features sensitive to damage can be lessened or removed without measurement of these conditions themselves. This is a very important issue in SHM, as often the effects of fluctuating environmental and operational conditions can mask any indication of damage to a structure that may be evident in structural response. In the thesis a solution to the problem based on the econometric theory of cointegration is introduced. Application of this theory is found to be ideally suited to remove unwanted environmental and operational trends from SHM data, and forms an exceedingly promising contribution to the development of SHM technology.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system’s purpose is to assist and inform the operators about continued fitness of the structures under gradual or sudden changes to their state of performance. Though ensuring safety of the structure is a vital issue, this issue alone may not be able to spread the field of SHM. It is also necessary to make economic evaluation of the SHM system. This study has compared the costs and benefit of I-35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge for two different cases (i.e. With SHM system and without SHM system). Costs and benefits associated with whole service life of the bridge have been considered for both cases. Different types of costs including capital costs, cost of SHM system, routine maintenance costs, anti-icing cost, inspection costs, major cost and repair cost has been considered in this study. Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) has been done to compare the cases. 40 years and 65 years of bridge service life has been considered for bridge without SHM and with SHM respectively. After the LCC analysis it was found that Benefit to Cost ratio is 17.5\% more in case of bridge with SHM than the bridge without SHM. SHM system also ensures bridge safety and will prevent any occurrence like bridge collapse. Due to extended bridge life and safety, bridge with SHM system will have a positive image to public.},

Due to environmental or electromagnetic effects and need for constant energy source, the traditional sensors are unable to provide accurate and continuous measurements. In light of these events, new and improved sensors have been developed, along with wireless technology, to assist the monitoring process. With the need of detecting more than one damage parameters, multiplexed sensors have been the main interest of researchers. This paper deals with the different sensors used for determination of strain, acceleration and corrosion. A brief comparative study has been performed and presented in the following review paper.

  abstract = {Continuous and real-time tension force monitoring is a key point in fatigue damage evaluation for bridge suspenders or hangers. Usually, effective sensors are not equipped in suspenders or hangers of in-service bridges to obtain tension force responses. Bridge-site-specified traffic loading information collected by Weigh-in-motion (WIM) system offers an opportunity to address this issue. The daily fatigue damage of hangers can be estimated by combination of the traffic loading data with finite element analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to establish the regression models between daily fatigue damage and collected traffic loading parameters. Consequently, the future fatigue damage of cables or hangers can be predicted by feeding the subsequent WIM data into the regression models. This proposed method is validated in the fatigue life prediction of hangers on a suspension bridge. The SVM model configuration and generalisation ability are investigated in this study. This study presents a novel way to estimate the fatigue damage of the hanger without direct stress sensing equipment and provides new thoughts in interpreting the monitoring data to provide useful information for engineering decision makers.},

It builds upon previous work which addressed the issue of reducing vast amounts of data collected during an SHM process by storing only those events regarded as being "interesting," thus decreasing the stored data to a manageable size. This capability is extended here by providing a means to group and classify these novel events using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Two types of neural systems are investigated, the first one consists of two neural layers employing both supervised and unsupervised learning. The second, which is an extension of the first, has a data pre-processing stage. In this later system, input data presented to the system is first pre-scaled before being presented to the first network layer. The scaling value is retained and later passed to the second layer as an extra input. The results obtained for vehicle classification using these two methods showed a success rate of 60\% and 90\% for the first and second ANN systems respectively.},

The modal parameters of the lower vibration modes were estimated from frequency response measurements obtained under harmonic excitation. The variation of natural frequencies shows an anomalous increase in the transition from one intermediate configuration to the next damage configurations. Changes in vibration modes are appreciable from the earliest level of damage. In particular, changes in modal curvature of lower modes do provide indication on the damage location.},

This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm, named improved Jaya (I-Jaya) algorithm, for structural damage identification with the modified objective function based on sparse regularization and Bayesian inference. To improve the global optimization capacity and robustness of the original Jaya algorithm, a clustering strategy is employed to replace solutions with low-quality objective values and a new updated equation is used for the best-so-far solution. The objective function that is sensitive and robust for effective and reliable damage identification is developed through sparse regularization and Bayesian inference and used for optimization analysis with the proposed I-Jaya algorithm. Benchmark tests are conducted to verify the improvement in the developed algorithm. Numerical studies on a truss structure and experimental validations on an experimental reinforced concrete bridge model are performed to verify the developed approach. A limited quantity of modal data, which is distinctively less than the number of unknown system parameters, are used for structural damage identification. Significant measurement noise effect and modelling errors are considered. Damage identification results demonstrate that the proposed method based on the I-Jaya algorithm and the modified objective function based on sparse regularization and Bayesian inference can provide accurate and reliable damage identification, indicating the proposed method is a promising approach for structural damage detection using data with significant uncertainties and limited measurement information. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}One of the main challenges in damage detection of in-service civil structures is the effect of operational and environmental changes. This paper presents a novel output-only vibration based method for detection of stiffness and mass changes in shear-type structures using a proposed time series analysis along with sensor clustering technique. AutoRegressive Moving Average models with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) are incorporated with the equations of motion written for different sensor clusters. Together with two assumptions, changes in the ARMAX model coefficients are employed to build Stiffness Damage Features (SDF) and Mass Damage Features (MDF). Using SDFs and MDFs, existence, location, severity of changes, i.e., stiffness reduction due to damage, and changes in mass due to operational conditions, can be identified separately and accurately. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in its current form, first, the shear-type IASC-ASCE numerical benchmark problem is employed. Subsequently, a laboratory-scale four-storey steel structure is developed and tested to study the proposed approach with experimental data. The results show that the approach can successfully identify the location and severity of damage and mass changes separately and very accurately using output-only vibration data.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {For the last decades vibration based damage detection of engineering structures has become an important issue for maintenance operations on transport infrastructure. Research in vibration based structural damage detection has been rapidly expanding from classic modal parameter estimation to modern operational monitoring. Since structures are subject to unknown ambient excitation in operation conditions, all estimates from the finite data measurements are of statistical nature. The intrinsic uncertainty due to finite data length, colored noise, non-stationary excitations, model order reduction or other operational influences needs to be considered for robust and automated structural health monitoring methods. In this paper, two subspace-based methods are considered that take these statistical uncertainties into account, first modal parameter and their confidence interval estimation for a direct comparison of the structural states, and second a statistical null space based damage detection test that completely avoids the identification step. The performance of both methods is evaluated on a large scale progressive damage test of a prestressed concrete road bridge, the S101 Bridge in Austria. In an on-site test, ambient vibration data of the S101 Bridge was recorded while different damage scenarios were introduced on the bridge as a benchmark for damage identification. It is shown that the proposed damage detection methodology is able to clearly indicate the presence of structural damage, if the damage leads to a change of the structural system.},

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring at local and global levels using computer vision technologies has gained much attention in the structural health monitoring community in research and practice. Due to the computer vision technology application advantages such as non-contact, long distance, rapid, low cost and labor, and low interference to the daily operation of structures, it is promising to consider computer vision–structural health monitoring as a complement to the conventional structural health monitoring. This article presents a general overview of the concepts, approaches, and real-life practice of computer vision–structural health monitoring along with some relevant literature that is rapidly accumulating. The computer vision–structural health monitoring covered in this article at local level includes applications such as crack, spalling, delamination, rust, and loose bolt detection. At the global level, applications include displacement measurement, structural behavior analysis, vibration serviceability, modal identification, model updating, damage detection, cable force monitoring, load factor estimation, and structural identification using input–output information. The current research studies and applications of computer vision–structural health monitoring mainly focus on the implementation and integration of two-dimensional computer vision techniques to solve structural health monitoring problems and the projective geometry methods implemented are utilized to convert the three-dimensional problems into two-dimensional problems. This review mainly puts emphasis on two-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring applications. Subsequently, a brief review of representative developments of three-dimensional computer vision in the area of civil engineering is presented along with the challenges and opportunities of two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring. Finally, the article presents a forward look to the future of computer vision–structural health monitoring.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Real-time control of next-generation active structures that experience unmodeled high-rate dynamic events require an up-to-date numerical model of the structural system. Examples of active structures that experience unmodeled high-rate dynamic events include hypersonic vehicles, active blast mitigation, and ballistic packages. Due to the dynamic environments that these structures operate in it follows that a numerical model of the system be updated on the timescale of less than 10~ms. Furthermore, the requirement for the monitoring of unmodeled high-rate dynamic events means that the proposed model updating technique cannot rely on precalculated data sets or offline training, therefore, the real-time structural updating technique must be capable of learning the state of the structure on-the-fly. This work proposes and validates an algorithmic framework for a millisecond error minimization model updating technique that updates a finite element analysis model of the structural system by minimizing the error between the structure's measured state and a series of parallelized models that are calculated in real-time with the structure as it moves through the high-rate dynamic event. The proposed algorithm is numerically and experimentally validated using an experimental testbed designed to simulate the dynamic events of projectiles in ballistic environments that consists of a cantilever beam and a movable roller support that introduces a continuously changing boundary condition to simulate a change in the structural system (i.e. damage). Experimental results demonstrate that the location of the roller on the testbed could be accurately tracked and updated every 4.04~ms with an accuracy of 2.9\% (10.05~mm over a beam of 350~mm) for a standard test profile and that the algorithm could track roller movement through an impact loading. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm demonstrated it was capable of tracking stochastic roller movement with an accuracy of 3.73\%. The delay in the estimated roller position caused by the time required to collect a sufficient quantity of vibration data, the need for constant excitation of the structure, and the robustness of the proposed algorithm are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Multisensor data fusion is the process of combining observations from a number of different sensors to provide a robust and complete description of an environment or process of interest. Data fusion finds wide application in many areas of robotics such as object recognition, environment mapping, and localization.This chapter has three parts: methods, architectures, and applications. Most current data fusion methods employ probabilistic descriptions of observations and processes and use Bayes’ rule to combine this information. This chapter surveys the main probabilistic modeling and fusion techniques including grid-based models, Kalman filtering, and sequential Monte Carlo techniques. This chapter also briefly reviews a number of nonprobabilistic data fusion methods. Data fusion systems are often complex combinations of sensor devices, processing, and fusion algorithms. This chapter provides an overview of key principles in data fusion architectures from both a hardware and algorithmic viewpoint. The applications of data fusion are pervasive in robotics and underly the core problem of sensing, estimation, and perception. We highlight two example applications that bring out these features.

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a shift in emphasis in bridge monitoring from instrumentation of the bridge to instrumentation of a passing vehicle, known by “drive-by bridge inspection”. This paper introduces a new method of identifying bridge damage using an instrumented truck; specifically using the truck acceleration histories to calculate changes in the “bridge displacement profile” which is shown to be sensitive to structural damage. The study includes three different bridges modeled as 1D FE beam elements and 2D FE plate elements. The simulation of the vehicle–bridge interaction is implemented in MATLAB. The truck is represented as a simple quarter car model crossing over a rough profile. The approach is also numerically tested for local damage in the bridge plate model. Finally, there is a study of sensitivity to signal noise, corrupted truck properties, initial conditions and transverse vehicle position.},

  abstract = {A Kalman filtering based framework for structural damage assessment under changing environmental conditions is presented. The approach is based on the well-known property that the filtering residual is a realization of a white stochastic process when the filter is operating under optimal conditions. To decouple structural damage and environmental effects two additional properties of the filtering residual are employed: i) under global changes in the structure caused by environmental variations the residual remains a white process, and thus its spectral density is approximately constant; ii) local changes caused by structural damage induce peaks in the residual spectral density at the affected vibration frequencies, and thus the residual is a colored process. A Bayesian whiteness test is employed to discriminate between the two situations under finite length data conditions (damage detection), while a normalized damage measure based on the spectral moments of the residual spectral density is proposed as a quantitative damage-sensitive feature (damage quantification). The proposed approach is numerically verified in a continuous beam model of a bridge under different operating conditions, including a robustness assessment for non-uniform temperature fields. It is shown that the approach has the capability to decouple physical changes caused by structural damage and varying environmental conditions, providing robust damage measures for structural health monitoring applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {The investigation and condition assessment of bridges have a very high priority in the construction industry today. Particularly, due to the fact that many bridge structures are getting old and partly reach the end of their useful life, the control and condition assessment of bridge structures have become very important and essential. The present research work introduces an efficient new method for condition assessment called the Deformation Area Difference (DAD) Method. This new method represents an attractive alternative to visual inspection and long-term monitoring. In this paper, the new method with its theoretical background is presented and explained by means of a laboratory experiment and some additional theoretical calculation examples. The experimental investigations have been realised on a reinforced concrete beam, which has been gradually loaded until failure. For each load step, the stiffness reduction and the apparent cracking have been monitored. High-precision measurements such as close-range photogrammetry, digital levelling and displacement sensors have been used for the determination of the deflection curve. The DAD method has been applied to identify the area of the crack pattern of the laboratory experiment. Furthermore, the method is discussed with regard to the load level and the precision of the deformation measurements. On the basis of the laboratory experiment, the applicability of the DAD method for damage detection could be proven. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the method with regard to the damage degree, the static system, the damage position and the impact of temperature variation were analysed.},

Comparative methods are needed that indicate the extent to which two communities differ given data sets of this type. UniFrac, which gives a somewhat ad hoc phylogenetics-based distance between two communities, is one of the most commonly used tools for these analyses. We provide a foundation for such methods by establishing that, if we equate a metagenomic sample with its empirical distribution on a reference phylogenetic tree, then the weighted UniFrac distance between two samples is just the classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein, or earth mover's, distance between the corresponding empirical distributions. We demonstrate that this Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance and extensions incorporating uncertainty in the sample locations can be written as a readily computable integral over the tree, we develop L p Zolotarev-type generalizations of the metric, and we show how the p-value of the resulting natural permutation test of the null hypothesis 'no difference between two communities' can be approximated by using a Gaussian process functional. We relate the L 2-case to an analysis-of-variance type of decomposition, finding that the distribution of its associated Gaussian functional is that of a computable linear combination of independent random variables. © 2012 Royal Statistical Society.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Although civil engineering problems are often characterized by significant levels of complexity, they are generally approached and solved by combining several practitioners' skills, such as intuition, past experience, logical reasoning, mathematical elaborations, and physical sense. This is also the case of problems in structural and earthquake engineering whose solution is generally based on the so-called "engineer's judgment". However, heuristic theories and algorithms within the framework of "soft computing" can provide a more rational and systematic way to approach and solve problems in these areas. As a matter of fact, the aforementioned algorithms have been recently utilized in several branches of engineering and applied sciences. This paper proposes a state-of-the-art review of the main applications of soft computing techniques to relevant structural and earthquake engineering problems. Specifically, the applications of fuzzy computing, evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence, and neural networks, as well as their hybrid combinations, are analyzed with the aim to examine their capability and limitations in modeling, simulation, and optimization problems.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Three-dimensional (3-D) FE models of the bridge corresponding to various damage scenarios considered for the experiment are constructed and calibrated using the modal parameters of the tested bridge extracted from vibration records obtained using a relatively dense measurement grid. A time series-based damage identification technique, autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models and sensor clustering, is evaluated using the real bridge data and the simulated bridge data obtained from the boundary value problem. Modification of the technique through incorporation of a new damage-sensitive feature (DSF) is proposed to enhance identification of the induced damage to this highly redundant bridge. The effects of damage locations, damage extents, and vibration measurement noise on the damage identification results of the bridge are investigated. The analysis results indicate that the damage identification technique can be successfully used to identify the existence of damage in this highly indeterminate bridge. It is found that damage location, damage extent, and vibration measurement noise significantly impact interpretation of the inferred damage location. The effects of interpretation parameters on the damage identification results are discussed in detail.},

Dynamic properties (resonant frequencies and mode shapes) of the undamaged and damaged bridge that were predicted by the numerical models were then correlated with experimental modal analysis results. Once correlated with the experimental results, eight new damage scenarios were introduced into the numerical model including a multiple damage case. Also, results from two undamaged cases were used to study the possibility that the damage identification methods would produce false-positive readings. In all cases analytical modal parameters were extracted from time-history analyses using signal processing techniques similar to those used in the experimental investigation.

  abstract = {In the 1960`s and 1970`s over 2500 bridges were built in the U.S. with a design similar to those on Interstate 40 over the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, New Mexico. These bridges were built without structural redundancy and typically have only two plate girders carrying the entire dead and live loads. Failure of either girder is assumed to produce catastrophic failure of the bridge, hence these bridges are referred to as fracture-critical bridges. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have provided funds to New Mexico State University (NMSU) through the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department (NMSH\&TD) and The Alliance For Transportation Research (ATR) for evaluation and testing of the existing fracture critical bridges over the Rio Grande. Because the 1-40 bridges over the Rio Grande were to be razed during the summer of 1993, the investigators were able to introduce simulated fatigue cracks, similar to those observed in the field, into the structure in order to test various damage identification methods and to observe the changes in load paths through the structure caused by the cracking. To support this research effort, NMSU contracted Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to perform experimental modal analyses, and to develop experimentally verified numerical models of the bridge. Scientists from the LANL`s Condensed Matter and Thermal Physics Group (P-10) applied state-of-the-art sensors and data acquisition software to the modal tests. Engineers from the LANL`s Advanced Engineering Technology Group (MEE-13) conducted ambient and forced vibration tests to verify detailed and simplified finite element models of the bridge. Forced vibration testing was done in conjunction with engineers from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) who provided and operated a hydraulic shaker.},

Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner.},

Therefore, standard time domain curve-fitting procedures, which are typically applied to impulse response functions, can now be applied to the cross-correlation functions to estimate the resonant frequencies and modal damping of the structure. This derivation is based on the assumption that the ambient vibration source is a white noise random process. Curve-fitting cross-correlation functions to obtain modal properties offers advantages over standard procedures that identify resonant frequencies from peaks in the power spectrum and damping from the width of the power spectrum. The primary advantage is the ability to identify closely spaced modes and their associated damping. The resonant frequencies of a highway bridge that were identified by curve-fitting the cross-correlation functions, using traffic excitation as the ambient vibration source, are compared to modal properties identified by standard forced vibration testing methods. Results of this comparison showed a maximum discrepancy of 3·63 percent. Similar comparisons for the average modal damping values identified by the two methods showed a 9·82 percent difference. This experimental verification implies that the proposed method of analyzing ambient vibration data can be used to accurately assess the dynamic properties of structures in a non-intrusive manner.},

Curiously absent, and critically important to the practical implementation of this work, is an accurate characterization of the natural variability of these modal parameters caused by effects other than damage. To examine this issue, a two-lane, seven-span, composite slab-on-girder bridge near the town of Truth or Consequences in southern New Mexico was tested several times over a period of nine months. Environmental effects common to this location that could potentially produce changes in the measured modal properties include changes in temperature, high winds, and changes to the supporting soil medium. In addition to environmental effects, variabilities in modal testing procedures and data reduction can also cause changes in the identified dynamic properties of the structure. In this paper the natural variability of the frequencies and mode shapes of the Alamosa Canyon bridge that result from changes in time of day when the test was performed, amount of traffic, and environmental conditions will be discussed. Because this bridge has not been in active use throughout the testing period, it is assumed that any change in the observed modal properties are the result of the factors listed above rather than deterioration of the structure itself.},

The economic cost of the monitoring systems limits their installation on smaller bridges which make up the wider transport network. A short-term monitoring system can be quickly installed and adjusted to suit the requirements of individual bridges. These systems are ideal for rural regions with a high number of single span bridges on isolated road and rail networks. This report will review a single span bridge on a private heritage railway under loading from passing steam engines, including the Flying Scotsman. Acceleration data are used to determine the rotations and deflections of the bridge deck. To verify the data, deflection measurements at mid-span were recorded using a video-based measurement system. The deflection measurements from the accelerometers correlate with the video imagery measurements.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the actual displacement response of a bridge subjected to random traffic loading is useful in evaluating bridge performance and serviceability. However, mounting displacement transducers is difficult, and the feasibility of and cost associated with such instrumentation are often problems. This research evaluated various methods to calculate the displacement response of a bridge using measured acceleration data. Methods included the use of integration schemes and the correction algorithms necessary for accurately determining displacements. Corrections are needed since any recorded signal contains error and the initial conditions of a structural system are not always known. Different numerical integration schemes and correction algorithms were applied to acceleration signals developed analytically, and these methods were then evaluated using acceleration signals recorded from laboratory tests. Finally, the methods were applied to acceleration data recorded from a field test of a highway bridge. In each case, the calculated displacement response was compared to the measured or exact displacement response to provide a basis for comparison. From the insight gained in this investigation, recommendations were made concerning the accurate determination of the displacement response of a bridge using accelerometer data.},

  abstract = {The resilience of the built environment to extreme weather events is fundamental for the day-to-day operation of our transport network, with scour representing one of the biggest threats to bridges built over flowing water. Condition monitoring of the bridge using a structural health monitoring system enhances resilience by reducing the time needed to return the bridge to normal use by providing timely information on structural condition and safety. The work presented in this report discusses use of rotational measurements in structural health monitoring. Traditionally tiltmeters (which can be a form of DC accelerometer) are used to measure rotation but are known to be affected by dynamic movements, while gyroscopes react quickly to dynamic motion but drift over time. This review will introduce gyroscopes as a complementary sensor for accelerometer rotational measurements and use sensor fusion techniques to combine the measurements from both sensors to get an optimised rotational result. This method was trialled on a laboratory scaled model, before the system was installed on an in-service single-span skewed railway bridge. The rotational measurements were compared against rotation measurements obtained using a vision-based measurement system to confirm the validity of the results. An introduction to gyroscopes, field test measurement results with the sensors and their correlation with the vision-based measurement results are presented in this article.},

Since strain sensing is very expensive in terms of power consumption a novel signal conditioning hardware was developed that enabled to significantly reduce the power consumption. An embedded data processing algorithm transformed the recorded raw data into a sequence of maxima and minima representing the strain cycles thus reducing data communication and enabling an additional energy saving. By using a software based event triggering algorithm the embedded data processing was performed only for data acquired during train transits. Strain cycles of more than 900 trains were recorded.

This study validates the potentials of the vision displacement sensor for cost-effective structural health monitoring. The results of laboratory experiments on simply-supported beam structures demonstrate the high accuracy of the vision sensor for dense full-field displacement measurements. The identified natural frequencies and mode shapes from measurements by using one camera match well with those from an array of accelerometers. Moreover, the smoother mode shapes make possible the noncontact damage detection based on the conventional mode shape curvature index. This study also discusses the issues concerning the practical applications of the vision displacement sensors, such as the scaling factor determination, measurement with small camera tilt angles, tradeoffs between the measurement resolution and measurement points or field of view, etc. Furthermore, the remote, real-time and multi-point measurement capacities of the vision sensor are confirmed through field tests of Manhattan Bridge during train passing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Most of the existing bridge superstructure damage detection methods are based on acceleration or strain response due to ambient excitation. This paper proposes a bridge damage detection procedure that utilizes vehicle-induced displacement response without requiring prior knowledge about the traffic excitation and road surface roughness. This study is partially motivated by the recent advances in convenient measurement of structural displacements enabled by video-based sensors. Vehicle–bridge interaction analysis shows that when subjected to moving vehicles, the bridge displacement response is dominated by the first-order mode component. This justifies the proposed damage detection method that only requires the first-order mode shape curvature. While conventionally the mode shapes are extracted based on operational modal analysis, the first-order mode shape is extracted by directly analyzing the power spectral density functions of measured bridge displacement responses under vehicle excitations. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the feasibility and performance of the proposed damage detection method using three damage scenarios including damage at single, double, and multiple locations, each involving several extents of damage defined by the reduction in element stiffness. The results reveal that all the damage cases can be successfully identified. Furthermore, the damage detection performance is evaluated for cases involving different classes of road surface roughness and less measurement points. The study demonstrates the potential of the proposed model-free and time-efficient method for damage detection of bridge structures. © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, these approaches require increased instrumentation complexity, and require calibration, necessitating bridge closures. In this paper, we explore the potential of using rotation measurements to create a more practical and cost-effective monitoring system. To this end, we present a damage detection method which directly analyses bridge rotation data measured under live, free-flow traffic loading. We show how the Earth Mover’s Distance, typically used in statistics and image processing, can be applied directly on end-of-span rotation measurement data to achieve effective damage detection and localisation. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the approach’s robustness to the confounding effects of temperature variation and traffic diversity (vehicle type, loading, and velocity). The direct rotation measurement approach is applied to data from an in-service short-span bridge to demonstrate the technique’s capability with free-flow traffic loading.},

  abstract = {In the Structural Health Monitoring of bridges, the effects of the operational and environmental variability on the structural responses have posed several challenges for early damage detection. In order to overcome those challenges, in the last decade recourse has been made to the statistical pattern recognition paradigm based on vibration data from long-term monitoring. This paradigm has been characterized by the use of purely data-based algorithms that do not depend on the physical descriptions of the structures. However, one drawback of this procedure is how to set up the baseline condition for new and existing bridges. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm with a Bayesian approach based on a Markovchain Monte Carlo method to cluster structural responses of the bridges into a reduced number of global state conditions, by taking into account eventual multimodality and heterogeneity of the data distribution. This approach stands as an improvement over the classical maximum likelihood estimation based on the expectation–maximization algorithm. Along with the Mahalanobis squared-distance, this approach permits one to form an algorithm able to detect structural damage based on daily response data even under abnormal events caused by temperature variability. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on standard data sets from a real-world bridge in Switzerland, namely the Z-24 Bridge. The analysis suggests that this algorithm might be useful for bridge applications because it permits one to overcome some of the limitations posed by the pattern recognition paradigm, especially when dealing with limited amounts of training data and/or data with nonlinear temperature dependency.},

While the approach is suitable for many sensing/actuation SHM processes, we focus on the example of active sensing using guided ultrasonic waves by implementing an appropriate statistical model of the wave propagation and feature extraction process. This example implements both pulse-echo and pitch-catch actuation schemes and takes into account line-of-site visibility and non-uniform damage probabilities over the monitored structure. The optimization space is searched using a genetic algorithm with a time-varying mutation rate.

  abstract = {Faulty sensor data often occur in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems using wireless smart sensor networks (WSSN). Serious sensor faults in the raw data may negatively affect SHM analysis and subsequent informed decisions. This issue is more critical for WSSN running decentralized data acquisition, because raw data are not transmitted back, and hence, data quality assessment can be extremely difficult for users. Therefore, developing efficient techniques to autonomously detect, identify, and recover sensor faults is essential. In the vibration data collected from the Jindo Bridge, some data sets are corrupted with sensor faults, which can be categorized as one of three types: drift, spikes, and bias. Accordingly, this paper presents a three-stage strategy to address this problem in WSSN. First, a distributed similarity test is employed to detect sensor faults; this test is based on the similarity of the power spectral density of the data among sensors within a cluster of nodes. Second, an artificial neural network model is trained to identify the types of sensor faults. Third, sensor data are recovered from the identified faults by applying a correction function or replacing faulty data with estimated values. Subsequently, numerical analysis is performed using a set of field measurements collected from the Jindo Bridge. Decentralized system identification is conducted using the original data and data recovered using the proposed strategy. The three-stage strategy is shown to successfully detect, identify, and recover sensor faults, which improves the results of system identification. Finally, the benefits and limitations of this strategy are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This issue becomes more important as information gathered by each node must be combined to form a global information subsequently analyzed. In the case of using WSN for Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) applied to Structural Health Monitoring, small synchronization errors can cause major problems in modal identification. Thus, a numerical experiment is presented in which the effects of these synchronization errors on the OMA estimation are shown. This controlled simulation allows us to analyze the mode shapes identified with and without error yielding important conclusions that may be used to improve estimations in future applications.},

  abstract = {One of the most prominent and comprehensive ways of data collection in sensor networks is to periodically extract raw sensor readings. This way of data collection enables complex analysis of data, which may not be possible with in-network aggregation or query processing. However, this flexibility in data analysis comes at the cost of power consumption. In this paper we develop ASAP − an adaptive sampling approach to energyefficient periodic data collection in sensor networks. The main idea behind ASAP is to use a dynamically changing subset of the nodes as samplers such that the sensor readings of the sampler nodes are directly collected, whereas the values of the non-sampler nodes are predicted through the use of probabilistic models that are locally and periodically constructed. ASAP can be effectively used to increase the network lifetime while keeping the quality of the collected data high, in scenarios where either the spatial density of the network deployment is superfluous relative to the required spatial resolution for data analysis or certain amount of data quality can be traded off in order to decrease the power consumption of the network. ASAP approach consists of three main mechanisms. First, sensing-driven cluster construction is used to create clusters within the network such that nodes with close sensor readings are assigned to the same clusters. Second, correlation-based sampler selection and model derivation are used to determine the sampler nodes and to calculate the parameters of the probabilistic models that capture the spatial and temporal correlations among the sensor readings. Last, adaptive data collection and model-based prediction are used to minimize the number of messages used to extract data from the network. A unique feature of ASAP is the use of in-network schemes, as opposed to the protocols requiring centralized control, to select and dynamically refine the subset of the sensor nodes serving as samplers and to adjust th},

These procedures, and particularly the physical measurement of the damage properties, are time-consuming and qualitative in nature. This paper proposes a novel method that automatically detects spalled regions on the surface of reinforced concrete columns and measures their properties in image data. Spalling has been accepted as an important indicator of significant damage to structural elements during an earthquake. According to this method, the region of spalling is first isolated by way of a local entropy-based thresholding algorithm. Following this, the exposure of longitudinal reinforcement (depth of spalling into the column) and length of spalling along the column are measured using a novel global adaptive thresholding algorithm in conjunction with image processing methods in template matching and morphological operations. The method was tested on a database of damaged RC column images collected after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and comparison of the results with manual measurements indicate the validity of the method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This work presents a simplified site-specific traffic load model that generates comparable load effects to the corresponding results from a full simulation. While the simplified model is still sensitive to the underlying assumptions, these can be carefully reviewed prior to the method being approved.

  abstract = {Girder displacement is an important component of bridge design and evaluation because it is directly related to bridge stiffness and flexibility. The complex interaction between vehicle and bridge dynamics will result in vibration and deflection greater than that under equivalent static load-ing. However, field measurement of girder displacement generally is nontrivial. Different sensors and instrumentation systems can be used to measure bridge displacement. Some of these provide direct measurements, whereas others indirectly provide displacement through measurements of the angle of rotation, velocity, or acceleration of the girder. Indirect methods, however, require additional signal processing analyses to remove the effect of small errors in recordings caused by sensor drift, unknown initial bridge conditions, and signal noise. These errors become sufficiently large through successive integrations and greatly distort the integrated velocity and displacement signals. Two correction methods are examined, namely, the velocity estimation method and the linear baseline correction method (BCM), for minimizing such errors in obtaining displacements indirectly from acceleration records. Independently measured girder acceleration and displacement records from a three-span continuous bridge under controlled live load testing are used to evaluate the accuracy of each method. It is found that the linear BCM results in a corrected displacement profile that more reasonably approximates the measured trace under various loading patterns. The choice of integration bound-aries is also shown to affect the accuracy of both methods. An objective approach based on the energy content of the signal is proposed.},

Field measurement of girder displacement, however, is generally nontrivial. Traditional sensors often require a stationary reference such as temporary scaffolds or a suspended cable. In either form, there are added costs, restrictions, and labor. As a result, there are both economic and practical incentives for developing methods that can use an accelerometer to measure both acceleration and displacement. One difficulty of this, however, is the presence of small low-frequency errors in the measured signal, which become sufficiently large through successive integrations and lead to a significantly distorted displacement profile.

By embedding fibre optic sensors in structures (e.g. buildings, bridges and pipelines) it is possible to obtain real time data on structural changes such as stress or strain. Engineers use monitoring data to detect deviations from a structure’s original design performance in order to optimise the operation, repair and maintenance of a structure over time. Fibre Optic Methods for Structural Health Monitoring is organised as a step-by-step guide to implementing a monitoring system and includes examples of common structures and their most-frequently monitored parameters. This book:  presents a universal method for static structural health monitoring, using a technique with proven effectiveness in hundreds of applications worldwide; discusses a variety of different structures including buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels and pipelines; features case studies which describe common problems and offer solutions to those problems; provides advice on establishing mechanical parameters to monitor (including deformations, rotations and displacements) and on placing sensors to achieve monitoring objectives; identifies methods for interpreting data according to construction material and shows how to apply numerical concepts and formulae to data in order to inform decision making.  Fibre Optic Methods for Structural Health Monitoring is an invaluable reference for practising engineers in the fields of civil, structural and geotechnical engineering.

  abstract = {Curved concrete bridge girders have very complex internal forces, stress and strain distribution. As a consequence of their shape, not only the usual bending moments and shear forces are generated, but also important torsion moments are created. These moments "rotate" the axes of principal tensional stresses increasing the risk of cracking. Post-tensioning can prevent the cracks, but the added compression forces introduced in different directions increase the complexity of stress and strain fields. Therefore, the curved post-tensioned concrete girders must be particularly designed and carefully constructed. However, the real structural behavior should be verified, and risks and uncertainties related to structural design and quality of construction minimized. Structural health monitoring is a natural solution for these issues. Structural health monitoring method, based on the use of fiber optic interferometric technology including long-gage sensors and inclinometers, is presented in this paper. A 36 meters long curved post-tensioned bridge box girder is equipped with so-called parallel and so-called crossed sensor topologies, and inclinometers, in order to monitor axial strain, both horizontal and vertical curvature changes, torsion, average shear strain and rotations in both vertical plans. Important parts of structure life such as construction, post-tensioning and first years of service are registered, analyzed and presented.},

  abstract = {Clock steering is an important discipline within the time and frequency community as well as in cognate disciplines such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). In the latter, clock steering is a mandatory tool for realizations of time scales, which first are typically created by algorithms forming a paper clock. Often, this software solution of a time scale is already sufficient. However, sometimes a realization in the form of a frequency signal is feasible or even necessary. Future GNSSs concepts plan to use composite clocks consisting of several different clocks to achieve synchronization of satellites within one orbit with the system time. In this approach, a real clock output in the microwave regime is indispensable. Therefore, a real clock has to be steered against the paper clock to realize the composite clock. Consequently, steering techniques are an essential piece for obtaining a realization. Besides the number of algorithms to choose from, there are several parameters that need to be defined by the user to achieve the best performance for distinct scenarios. In this paper we compare the realization performance and applicability of two different steering techniques, namely linear-quadratic Gaussian control and pole placement, in a simplified hardware setup. The studied scenario consists of a steerable clock consisting of a micro phase stepper which changes the frequency of the output of an ovencontrolled quartz oscillator (OCXO) and a rubidium atomic clock (RB). The OCXO in turn is steered to follow the free-running RB as closely as possible. Steering the output of the OCXO introduces a new process in the clock. As a result, the Allan deviation of the steered clock shows a bump which location is dependent on the chosen control interval and steering technique. This has to be considered for the designated operation. We compare simulations of the clock steering with both techniques to real-data results from our laboratory.},

The proposed method is composed in its first stage of an artificial neural network and on the second stage of a gaussian process. The proposed method is applicable to railway bridges, since it takes advantage of the fact that vehicles of known axle configuration cross the bridge regularly, that normally only one train is on the bridge at a time and that the lateral positioning of the loads does not change. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that it makes use of the data on the load’s position, magnitude and speed that can be obtained from a Bridge Weigh-in-Motion system to improve the accuracy of the damage detection algorithm. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Most of this research demonstrates their effectiveness by showing that a singularity that did not appear in the healthy structure is present in the response of the damaged structure. This paper elucidates from first principles how the acceleration response can be assumed to consist of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ components, and where the beam has experienced a localised loss in stiffness, an additional ‘damage’ component. The combination of these components establishes how the damage singularity will appear in the total response. For a given damage severity, the amplitude of the ‘damage’ component will depend on how close the damage location is to the sensor, and its frequency content will increase with higher velocities of the moving force. The latter has implications for damage detection because if the frequency content of the ‘damage’ component includes bridge and/or vehicle frequencies, it becomes more difficult to identify damage. The paper illustrates how a thorough understanding of the relationship between the ‘static’ and ‘damage’ components contributes to establish if damage has occurred and to provide an estimation of its location and severity. The findings are corroborated using accelerations from a planar finite element simulation model where the effects of force velocity and bridge span are examined.},

  abstract = {The maintenance and repair of bridges (and other large scale infrastructure projects) is a major area which could benefit from Structural Health Monitoring technology. Inspections on bridges can take a long time and require many people, and are therefore conducted infrequently. This low frequency of inspection leaves the chance that damage and dangerous critical failures can occur during the long timeframes between inspections. It might even be the case that an inspection fails to identify sub-surface damage. Therefore some form of continuous monitoring is desirable, especially if such systems can reliably detect sub-surface damage. However, the application of SHM to bridges is made challenging by the cost and practicability of obtaining damage-state data for bridges. Over the lifetime of a single bridge, it is hoped that a critical failure will never occur, and only a small number of the possible damage states will occur. It is also unpractical to intentionally damage structures to obtain damage-state data. Population-based structural health monitoring seeks to overcome the obstacle of the limited data available for a single structure, by allowing data to be shared between similar structures. Bridges represent an interesting challenge for PBSHM as each bridge is unique. As such, an assessment of how similar bridges are to each other is required. To provide this assessment, one must develop an abstract representation for each bridge, and using this to perform a comparison. This paper describes the use of a general approach for assessing the similarity of structures, applied to several bridge examples which are representative of common types of bridges, to show that it can be applied in this field.},

The study focused on routine and in-depth inspection, the two most prevalent forms of visual inspection of bridges. Because visual inspection is a highly subjective nondestructive evaluation technique, the results of these bridge inspections can be highly variable and are dependent on many factors. This study included the completion of 10 bridge inspection tasks by 49 practicing state bridge inspectors. With regard to routine inspections, this study showed that condition ratings are assigned with significant variability. Specifically, approximately 68\% of condition ratings are within 1 rating point of the average. The results of the in-depth superstructure inspections indicated that these inspections are not likely to detect and identify the specific types of defects for which this inspection procedure is sometimes prescribed. Specifically, widespread defects such as those normally noted during a routine inspection are likely to be noted; however, local deficiencies, such as crack indications, are unlikely to be detected. The results of the deck delamination survey indicate that the accuracy of this type of inspection is relatively poor, with few inspection teams providing results that could be considered to accurately portray the condition of the deck.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) often have limited battery capacity-sensor nodes (SNs), which severely limit continuous monitoring-based Internet-of-Things applications. To substantially increase the lifetime of a densely deployed WSN for monitoring spatio-temporally varying signal, this paper presents a novel sparse Bayesian learning-based adaptive sensor selection framework. The developed strategy selects an active sensor set and turns off the remaining SNs by jointly optimizing two conflicting performance measures: 1) sensing quality and 2) energy efficiency, while considering prevailing energy parameters of the network. To achieve this, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated. Further, a joint principal component analysis-sparse Bayesian learning (PCA-SBL) scheme is presented which uses PCA-based estimated transformation matrix to sparsify the data sensed by sensors, and subsequently uses approximate overcomplete dictionary-based SBL scheme to estimate it. Employing PCA-SBL-based signal estimate, a closed loop adaptive mechanism is developed which estimates variations of the monitored signal to predict the number of active sensors for next measurement cycle such that the sensing error remains within an acceptable range. This predicted value is then used in sensor selection problem to dynamically select the active set. The sensor selection, signal recovery, and feedback loop use spatial and temporal correlation inherent in the monitored phenomenon. Extensive simulation studies validate the energy efficiency and stable sensing performance of the proposed framework using both synthetic and real data of a WSN.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a three-tier algorithmic framework as the basis for the flexible design of data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. The three major functions of the SHM system, including data normalization, feature extraction and hypothesis testing, are mapped to the three layers of the framework. The first tier of the framework is devoted to data normalization. Machine learning (ML) methods are adopted to normalize available datasets by binning datasets to similar environmental and operational conditions (EOC) of the system. Specifically, affinity propagation clustering is used to delineate data into groups of similar EOC. Once data is normalized by EOC, the second tier of the framework extracts features from the data to serve as condition parameters (CP) for damage assessment. To ascertain the health state of the structure, the third tier of the framework is devoted to statistical analysis of the CP through hypothesis testing (HT). An intrinsic goal of the study is to explore the modularity of the three tier framework as a means of offering SHM system designers opportunity to explore and test different computational block-sets at each layer to maximize the detection capability of the SHM system. Various realizations of the three-tier modular framework are presented and applied to acceleration and EOC data collected from an operational 3 kW wind turbine. A total of 354 data sets are collected from the turbine including tower lateral accelerations in two orthogonal directions at six heights, wind speed and wind direction; 317 of the data sets correspond to the wind turbine in a healthy state and 37 with the wind turbine in a damage state. Using quantitative metrics derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the damage classification capabilities of the framework are validated and shown to accurately identify intentionally introduced damage in the turbine.},

  abstract = {It is well known that Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can provide high accuracy information on the position, velocity, and attitude over a short time period. However, their accuracy degrades rapidly with time. The requirements for accurate estimation of navigation information necessitate the modeling of the sensors’ noise components. Several methods have been devised for stochastic modeling of inertial sensors noise. Each of them is useful but each has its own disadvantage. The Adaptive Kalman filter is one of the mostly used methods to estimate inertial sensor noise, but the form of the model needs to be known first. Frequency domain approaching uses the power spectral density to estimate transfer functions. It is straightforward but it is difficult for non- system analysts to understand. In the time domain methods, the correlation function approach is very model sensitive. Variance techniques are basically very similar, and primarily differ only in that various signal processing, by way of weighting functions, window functions, etc., are incorporated into the analysis algorithms in order to achieve a particular desired result for improving the model characterizations. The simplest technique is the Allan variance method. Allan variance is a method of representing root mean square (RMS) random drift error as a function of average time. It is simple to compute and relatively simple to interpret and understand. Allan variance method can be used to determine the character of the underlying random processes that give rise to the data noise. This technique can be used to characterize various types of noise terms in the inertial sensor data by performing certain operations on the entire length of data. In this thesis, the Allan variance technique is used in noise analysis of different grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), which include: ß Navigation grade IMU: The Honeywell Commercial IMU (CIMU); ß Tactical grade IMU: The Honeywell HG1700; and iiiß Consumer grade MEMS based IMU: The Systron Donner MotionPak II-3g By performing a simple operation on the entire length of data, a characteristic curve is obtained whose inspection provides a systematic characterization of various random errors contained in the inertial sens or output data. Being a directly measurable quantity, Allan variance can provide information on the types and magnitude of various noise terms. The research work will cover both the theoretical basis for Allan Variance for modeling inertial sensors noise terms, and its implementation in modeling different noise terms existing in the different grade inertial sensors. Simple implementation and ease of interpretation make the Allan variance method suitable in inertial sensor noise identification and stochastic modeling.},

Internet technology was successfully incorporated into structural health monitoring, which makes it possible to manage real-time sensing data and centralize the remote structural monitoring systems. With the increase in size and complexity of the monitored structures, more sensors and data acquisition equipment is involved. This paper addresses some specific issues related to long distance small signal transmission and Ethernet IP sharing between different devices. The issue of data volume versus storage space and communication bandwidth is discussed especially in the application of web camera image transfer and recording. The approaches are illustrated through reference to two current case studies, which include a bridge and a statue. It can be seen that these practical solutions employed by ISIS Canada are easy to implement and reduce the cost for the maintenance of SHM systems. The paper also discusses future activities and research needs related to the reliability and security of the SHM system.},

In this study, an approach to anomaly detection was performed on a real-world bridge using temperature and rotation data collected by a structural health monitoring system. First, the state equation of a beam under a quasi-static process was established based on thermodynamics. The state equation was then validated through a case study. Subsequently, the thermodynamics state equation of rotation and Bayesian theory were combined to obtain a double-index anomaly detection method, which was applied to a real-world bridge. The results showed that the double-index method effectively detected the bridge anomaly, and the anomaly of the bridge was induced by ice and snow loads. This work provides a thermodynamic perspective for diagnosis in civil structures.},

  abstract = {Mode shapes estimated from the vehicle responses are normally used to detect bridge damage efficiently for their high spatial resolution. However, an updated baseline finite element model (FEM) is normally required to quantify damages for such an approach. A two-stage damage detection procedure is presented for bridges by utilizing the mode shape estimated from a moving vehicle. Damage locations are first determined through a damage localization index (DLI) defined by regional mode shape curvature (RMSC). Then the relationship between the damage extents and the RMSC changes is investigated by FEM simulation. Finally, an equation set to quantify the single and multiple damages is deduced by combining the RMSCs and the relationship between the damage extents and the RMSC changes established by an un-updated FEM. Numerical and experimental examples are carried out to verify the validity and efficiency of the two-stage method. The results revealed that it can localize and quantify damages with satisfactory precision by using the response measured from one sensor only.}

  abstract = {Monitoring deflections provides a powerful diagnostic tool for structural health monitoring of bridges. Excessive deflections under service loads may be indicative of structural changes, damage and deterioration. For the real time monitoring of deflections under operating traffic loads, it is often difficult to establish a fixed reference point for displacement transducers either because the bridge crosses over a body of water or a roadway. Moreover, vandalism and environmental conditions disrupt and more than likely alter the fixity of the reference points. The work presented in this study pertains to the development of a method for real time remote monitoring of bridge deflections. From the practical point of view, the primary attribute of the proposed method is its capability for making reference free estimates of bridge deflections. The formulations employ the measured rotations and curvatures of the bridge for this purpose. The feasibility of the approach was tested on two different highway bridges. Both bridges were instrumented with a number of different fiber optic sensors that included tiltmeters and strain gauges. Conventional transducers and displacement measurement devices were also used in parallel in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A series of load tests were conducted at both bridge sites that included use of trucks with known weights. In addition, finite element models were developed and employed for further verification of the proposed approach. Field test measurement results and their correlations with the conventional methods as well as comparison with the finite element models are described in this article. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper pays specific attention to measuring and identifying the behaviour of the bridge bearings of a short span highway bridge, as well as the static and dynamic data commonly used for model updating. This is important because while it is widely accepted that correct simulation of boundary conditions in a Finite Element (FE) model is crucial to the accuracy of the model, few researchers have actually attempted to measure bearing movement as part of their model updating strategy. To demonstrate the approach and the benefits of tracking bearing movement two separate updated FE models of the bridge were developed; (i) was updated using dynamic performance information, and (ii) was updated using response to quasi-static loading. The inclusion of bearing behaviour data proved to be very important, as in (i) it was found that during ambient vibration testing with low level dynamic response to light traffic, the friction on the bridge bearings was such that they were effectively behaving as ‘pinned-pinned’, as opposed to ‘pinned-roller’ as indicated by the bridge drawings. Using this observation it was possible to get the updated model (i) to match very closely with the experimentally measured frequencies and mode shapes. Without this information, conventional model updating optimisation would likely have driven the system parameters (e.g. Young’s modulus, deck mass) to unrealistic values in order to get the FE predictions to match the experimentally observed frequencies. For the static model (ii) it was again observed that friction on the bearing was playing a significant role in the behaviour of the bridge and this was exploited to develop a simple but effective updated FE model that accurately predicted the bridge response during two separate static load tests. No single FE model could represent the bridge for both types of loading but in both cases the bearing performance data were critical in getting the relevant model to match the experimentally observed values.},

Initially, numerical analyses are carried out on a one-dimensional (1D) simply supported beam model loaded with a single moving point load to investigate the sensitivity of rotation as a main parameter for damage identification. As a result of this study, the difference in rotation measurements due to a single moving point load obtained for healthy and damaged states is proposed as a damage indicator. A relatively simple laboratory experiment is conducted on a 3-m long simply supported beam structure to validate the results obtained from the numerical analysis. The case of multi-axle vehicles is investigated through numerical analyses of a 1D bridge model and a theoretical basis for damage detection is presented. Finally, a sophisticated 3D dynamic finite element model of a 20-m long simply supported bridge structure is developed by an independent team of researchers and used to test the robustness of the proposed damage detection methodology in a series of blind tests. Rotations from an extensive range of damage scenarios were provided to the main team who applied their methods without prior knowledge of the extent or location of the damage. Results from the blind test simulations demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides a reasonable indication of the bridge condition for all test scenarios.},

  abstract = {Bridge failure to pass load capacity assessment is unfortunately not an uncommon problem in bridge engineering and it is a potentially expensive problem for the bridge owner. Using load test data to justify increase in assessed load capacity is recognised as a viable approach in professional codes of practice. However, load tests are rarely carried out in practice because traditionally they are expensive to conduct and may not always justify an increase in assessed load capacity. Therefore this paper proposes a simple, quick and reliable approach for bridge load testing. In particular a procedure to calculate the bridge displacement to a moving truck by double integration of bridge acceleration is presented. Integrating acceleration to calculate displacement is not a new approach, with authors reporting difficulties due to errors in acceleration signals and unknown initial conditions. Many of the previous approaches have focused on developing signal processing algorithms to correct for the signal errors and while some good results have been reported, typically the derived displacements are very sensitive to parameters used in the correction algorithm, such as passband filter frequencies. Consequently, without comparison with directly measured displacement data, reliability of the procedure cannot be established and errors quantified. Therefore in this study a stripped down procedure is applied placing emphasis instead on minimising the errors in the recorded acceleration by using appropriate hardware and developing a quality control procedure that allows the user to assess the likely accuracy of the calculated displacement signal. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is trialled in the laboratory and in the field, with an accuracy of ±0.5 mm observed.},

The motivation for application to civil structures is that their capabilities and simple operating procedures make them suitable for modal testing of many types of civil infrastructure of limited dimension including footbridges and floors while also enabling recovering of dynamic forces generated and applied to structures by moving humans. To explore their capabilities in civil applications, the IMUs are evaluated through modal tests on three different structures with increasing challenge of spatial and environmental complexity. These are, a full-scale floor mock-up in a laboratory, a short span road bridge and a seven story office tower. For each case, the results from the IMUs are compared with those from a conventional wired system to identify the limitations. The main conclusion is that the relatively high noise floor and limited communication range will not be a serious limitation in the great majority of typical civil modal test applications where convenient operation is a significant advantage over conventional wired systems.},

  abstract = {Previous research based on theoretical simulations has shown the potential of the wavelet transform to detect damage in a beam by analysing the time-deflection response due to a constant moving load. However, its application to identify damage from the response of a bridge to a vehicle raises a number of questions. Firstly, it may be difficult to record the difference in the deflection signal between a healthy and a slightly damaged structure to the required level of accuracy and high scanning frequencies in the field. Secondly, the bridge is going to have a road profile and it will be loaded by a sprung vehicle and time-varying forces rather than a constant load. Therefore, an algorithm based on a plot of wavelet coefficients versus time to detect damage (a singularity in the plot) appears to be very sensitive to noise. This paper addresses these questions by: (a) using the acceleration signal, instead of the deflection signal, (b) employing a vehicle–bridge finite element interaction model, and (c) developing a novel wavelet-based approach using wavelet energy content at each bridge section, which proves to be more sensitive to damage than a wavelet coefficient line plot at a given scale as employed by others.},

In this study, a new approach is presented to facilitate the extraction of frequencies and mode shapes of full-scale civil infrastructure from video obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This approach addresses directly a number of difficulties associated with modal analysis of full-scale infrastructure using vision-based methods.

  abstract = {Bridges are critical components of highways ensuring traffic can efficiently travel over obstructions such as bodies of water, valleys, and other roads. Ensuring bridges are in sound structural condition is essential for safe and efficient highway operations. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems designed to measure bridge responses have been developed to quantitatively track the health of bridges. More recently, SHM systems have also begun to integrate measurement of vehicular loads that create the responses measured. However, precise correlation of traffic loads to bridge responses remains a costly and technically difficult strategy. To address existing technical limitations, a cyber-physical system (CPS) framework is proposed to track truck loads in a highway corridor, to trigger SHM systems to record bridge responses, and to automate the linking of bridge response data with truck weights collected by weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations installed along the corridor but not collocated with the bridges. To link truck weights to bridge responses, computer vision methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to automate the detection and reidentification of trucks using traffic cameras. The single-stage CNN object detector YOLO is trained using a customized dataset to identify trucks from camera images at each instrumentation site; high precision is obtained with the YOLO detector exceeding 95\% average precision (AP) for an intersection over union (IOU) threshold of 0.75. To reidentify the same truck at different locations in the corridor, this study adopts a CNN-based encoder trained via a triplet network and a mutual nearest neighbor strategy using feature vectors extracted from images at each measurement location. The proposed reidentification method is implemented in the CPS cloud environment and obtains a F1-score of 0.97. The study also explores the triggering of bridge monitoring systems based on visual detection of trucks by a traffic camera installed upstream to the bridges. The triggering strategy proves to be highly efficient with 99\% of the triggered data collection cycles capturing truck events at each bridge. To validate, the CPS architecture is implemented on a 20-mile highway corridor that has a WIM station already installed; four traffic cameras and two bridge SHM systems are installed along the corridor and integrated with a CPS architecture hosted on the cloud. In total, over 10,000 trucks are observed at all measurement locations over one year allowing peak bridge responses to be correlated to both measured truck weights and to one another.},

For bridges over rivers, railways, or highways, a direct measurement method is impractical. A promising bridge deflection measurement method (inclinometer method) is presented in this paper. It offers a simple, practical and inexpensive method of measuring static and dynamic deflections of bridge spans under loads, even for bridge spans that traverse great heights. Hundreds of experiments and practical tests on simple and continuous bridges, utilizing dynamic and static loads, under various vehicle speeds, show that the method has very high precision, which provides an authentic basis for new-built bridge acceptance and old bridge safety evaluation. The method does not need fixed observation positions as other deflection measurement methods because the inclinometers are installed on the bridge directly, which increases measurement efficiency greatly. These features indicate that as a potential method of measuring bridge deflection, inclinometers have significant engineering application value and a promising future.},

Three inclinometer sensor nodes were mounted on two of the elastomeric bearing pads to measure the change in inclination of the bearing pads while a final node monitored temperature in the box that contained the gateway.

To make the affine projection algorithm applicable for parameter estimation in wireless sensor networks, this work proposed a novel distributed affine projection algorithm by using the adapt-then-combine (ATC) scheme of the diffusion strategy.

Thus, we develop an improved ATC diffusion affine projection algorithm (improved ATC-dAPA) with adaptive node selection to maintain the estimation accuracy. The mean and mean square deviation of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The numerical simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve more accurate estimations than several related algorithms.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}One important topic for structural health monitoring methods is to find a balance in the number of sensors, the accuracy in damage detection and the requirement of a high-fidelity finite element model. Traditional deterministic damage detection techniques with a limited number of sensors can only provide coarse point estimates, and they can be vulnerable to uncertainties such as noise and changing environments. This paper adopts the Bayesian probabilistic approach combined with a perturbation model for probabilistic damage characterization utilizing dynamic responses at a few vibration nodes. Vibrational amplitudes at nodal points, also referred as node displacement or NODIS, can be considered to be an efficient structural damage indicator because they have the potential to achieve real-time damage assessment with a relatively small number of sensors. In the Bayesian framework, an efficient perturbation-based surrogate model is adopted to replace the FE model which is computationally costly. This paper proposes a vibration-based SHM method that is suitable for real-time monitoring, requires a small number of industrial sensors, does not rely on a high-fidelity FE model and can be applied for damage assessment of location and severity. The performance of the NODIS-based Bayesian framework with the perturbation method is evaluated and compared with FE results. The proposed method is applied to a supporting structure of a sailplane under different environmental temperatures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we introduce and develop a new approach to quantify deviations in the underlying hidden generators of observed data streams, resulting in a new efficiently computable universal metric for time series. The proposed metric is in the sense that we can compare and contrast data streams regardless of where and how they are generated and without any feature engineering step. The approach proposed in this paper is conceptually distinct from our previous work on data smashing, and vastly improves discrimination performance and computing speed. The core idea here is the generalization of the notion of KL divergence often used to compare probability distributions to a notion of divergence in time series. We call this the sequence likelihood (SL) divergence, which may be used to measure deviations within a well-defined class of discrete-valued stochastic processes. We devise efficient estimators of SL divergence from finite sample paths and subsequently formulate a universal metric useful for computing distance between time series produced by hidden stochastic generators.},

For this purpose, simulation, FEM analyses of a damaged cantilever plexiglass beam under kinematic excitations are carried out and verified experimentally. Three types of rotation rate sensors are examined. Damage index based on the maximum difference of signals on both sides of the damaged location is compared with averaged damage indices in time and frequency domain. It is demonstrated that the rotation velocities of the beam axis are less sensitive to measurement noise than the transversal accelerations. A simple damage index based on peak response and two, integral damage indices were tested using numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. The integral time-domain damage index appeared to be equally useful in damage detection, like the index based on the transmissibility concept. The results of the experiments show positive prospects for constructing Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) networks using rotation rate sensors. This is particularly important for future SHM systems to be commonly implemented in civil engineering.},

The sensitivity of rotation to damage and the effect of sensor locations on sensor sensitivities are investigated. Subsequently, extensive laboratory experiments are conducted on a 5.4\,m long simply supported bridge structure in an effort to validate the results from the numerical analyses. The test structure is instrumented with rotation sensors and axle detectors and loaded with a four-axle moving vehicle. In this study, rotations are measured using high grade uniaxial accelerometers. The procedure of measuring rotations using accelerometers is explained within the scope of this study. To test the robustness of the proposed bridge condition assessment methodology, a wide range of single and multiple damage scenarios is investigated and the results from this study show that the proposed methodology can successfully identify damage on a bridge.

Damage was incorporated by bolting stiffening plates onto localized sections of the test bridge. This “negative damage” concept, consisting of local increases in stiffness, allows several damage scenarios to be investigated on the test bridge.

Currently, the GPS technique can only be applied to flexible structures having lower modal frequency ranges, and it still has remaining issues when it comes to obtaining accurate measurements. However, the application of GPS is promising as a monitoring tool because it can measure dynamic characteristics and static displacements in real time, whereas the conventional monitoring system using accelerometers cannot measure static and quasi-static displacements. Furthermore, rapid advancements in GPS devices and algorithms can mitigate erroneous sources of GPS data, and integrated systems using GPS receivers with other supplement sensors are capable of providing accurate measurements. Therefore, GPS technology can provide accurate displacements of structures in real time, and stress and strain conditions of the structures can be computed using finite-element models and numerical analyses. It is also expected that damage localization and severity can be identified using the dynamic characteristics of structures obtained from GPS.

  abstract = {Automatic health monitoring and maintenance of civil infrastructure systems is a challenging area of research. Nondestructive evaluation techniques, such as digital image processing, are innovative approaches for structural health monitoring. Current structure inspection standards require an inspector to travel to the structure site and visually assess the structure conditions. A less time consuming and inexpensive alternative to current monitoring methods is to use a robotic system that could inspect structures more frequently. Among several possible techniques is the use of optical instrumentation (e.g. digital cameras) that relies on image processing. The feasibility of using image processing techniques to detect deterioration in structures has been acknowledged by leading experts in the field. A survey and evaluation of relevant studies that appear promising and practical for this purpose is presented in this study. Several image processing techniques, including enhancement, noise removal, registration, edge detection, line detection, morphological functions, colour analysis, texture detection, wavelet transform, segmentation, clustering and pattern recognition, are key pieces that could be merged to solve this problem. Missing or deformed structural members, cracks and corrosion are main deterioration measures that are found in structures, and they are the main examples of structural deterioration considered here. This paper provides a survey and an evaluation of some of the promising vision-based approaches for automatic detection of missing (deformed) structural members, cracks and corrosion in civil infrastructure systems. Several examples (based on laboratory studies by the authors) are presented in the paper to illustrate the utility, as well as the limitations, of the leading approaches.},

The central components of the WSSN deployment are the Imote2 smart sensor platforms, a custom-designed multimetric sensor boards, base stations, and software provided by the Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project (ISHMP) Services Toolsuite. In total, 70 sensor nodes and two base stations have been deployed to monitor the bridge using an autonomous SHM application with excessive wind and vibration triggering the system to initiate monitoring. Additionally, the performance of the system is evaluated in terms of hardware durability, software stability, power consumption and energy harvesting capabilities. The Jindo Bridge SHM system constitutes the largest deployment of wireless smart sensors for civil infrastructure monitoring to date. This deployment demonstrates the strong potential of WSSNs for monitoring of large scale civil infrastructure.},

For instance, vehicle classification is helpful in monitoring heavy vehicle traffic for road maintenance and safety, modeling traffic flow, and obtaining performance measurements based on each vehicle class for traffic surveillance. A real-time vehicle classification model was introduced. A heuristic method combined with decision tree and K-means clustering approaches was proposed to develop the vehicle classification model. The features used in the proposed model were extracted from piecewise slope rate values, which were obtained from single-loop inductive signature data. Three vehicle classification schemes–FHWA, FHWA-I, and Real-time Traffic Performance Measurement System–and a data set obtained from square single-loop detectors were used for model development. A data set obtained from round single-loop detectors was applied to test the transferability of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that the proposed real-time vehicle classification model is not only capable of categorizing vehicle types on the basis of the FHWA scheme but also is capable of grouping vehicles into more detailed classes. The classification model can successfully classify vehicles into 15 classes using single-loop detector data without any explicit axle information. In addition, the advantages of the proposed vehicle classification model are its simplicity, its use of the current detection infrastructure, and its enhancement of the use of single-loop detectors for vehicle classification. The initial results also suggest the potential for transferability of the vehicle classification approach and are very encouraging.},

  abstract = {In this study, a new vehicle classification algorithm was developed with inductive loop signature technology. There were two steps to the proposed algorithm. The first step was to use the Haar wavelet to transform and reconstruct inductive vehicle signatures, and the second step was to group vehicles into FHWA vehicle types through the use of the k nearest neighbor (KNN) approach with a Euclidean distance classifier. To determine the proper proportion of the wavelet to apply for reconstruction and feature extraction, transformed signatures were examined with percentages of large components of their corresponding wavelets. To implement the KNN approach, a library of vehicle signature templates for each FHWA vehicle class was composed. The proposed vehicle classification algorithm demonstrated promising classification results, with a 92.4\% overall accuracy. The algorithm can be applied to the real world without the concerns about recalibration and transferability that arise with the use of signature data from single loops. Two additional vehicle classification schemes were applied for performance evaluation. For the inductive signature performance evaluation classification scheme, which aimed to facilitate emission analysis and easy interpretation, the overall accuracy was 94.1\%. For the axle-based vehicle classification scheme proposed in this project, which aimed to group vehicles by use and the number of axles, the overall accuracy was 93.8\%. Future research will focus on refinement of the signature template library for each FHWA vehicle type to further improve the performance of the proposed vehicle classification algorithm. The selection of the value of k for the KNN approach will be investigated also.},

In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and big data, cloud computing has been widely developed in many industrial applications involving large volume of data. Appropriate use of cloud computing infrastructure can enhance the long-term deployment of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system which would incur significant amount of data of different types. This paper presents a cloud-based cyberinfrastructure platform designed to support bridge monitoring. The cyberinfrastructure platform enables scalable management of SHM data and facilitates effective information sharing and data utilisation. A cloud-based platform comprises of virtual machines, distributed database and web servers. The peer-to-peer distributed database architecture provides a scalable and fault-tolerant data management system. Platform-neutral web services designed in compliant with the Representational State Transfer (REST) standard enables easy access to the cloud resources and SHM data. For data interoperability, a bridge information model for bridge monitoring applications is adopted. For demonstration, the scalable cloud-based platform is implemented for the monitoring of bridges along the I-275 corridor in the State of Michigan. The results show that the cloud-based cyberinfrastructure platform can effectively manage the sensor data and bridge information and facilitate efficient access of the data as well as the bridge monitoring software services.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of damage identification in complex civil infrastructure with an integrative modular Bayesian framework. The proposed approach uses multiple response Gaussian processes to build an informative yet computationally affordable probabilistic model, which detects damage through inverse updating. Performance of structural components associated with parameters of the developed model was quantified with a damage metric. Particular emphasis is given to environmental and operational effects, parametric uncertainty and model discrepancy. Additional difficulties due to usage of costly physics-based models and noisy observations are also taken into account. The framework has been used to identify a reduction of a simulated cantilever beam elastic modulus, and anomalous features in main/stay cables and bearings of the Tamar bridge. In the latter case study, displacements, natural frequencies, temperature and traffic monitored throughout one year were used to form a reference baseline, which was compared against a current state, based on one month worth of data. Results suggest that the proposed approach can identify damage with a small error margin, even under the presence of model discrepancy. However, if parameters are sensitive to environmental/operational effects, as observed for the Tamar bridge stay cables, false alarms might occur. Validation with monitored data is also highlighted and supports the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Temperature effects on cube compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, prism compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and frequency are conducted and discussed. The results indicate that static mechanical properties such as compressive strength (cube and prism), splitting tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity have highly linear negative correlation with temperature; this law is also applied to the first order frequency of concrete slab. The coupling effect of temperature and damage on change rate of frequency reveals that temperature effect cannot be ignored in damage identification of structure. Mechanism analysis shows that variation of elastic modulus of concrete caused by temperature is the primary reason for the change of frequency.},

  abstract = {In-service bridge structural performance analysis and prediction are usually complicated and challenging because of many unknown and uncertain factors. Contrary to the traditional structural appearance inspections and load tests, structural health monitoring (SHM) can provide a perspective for online analysis, prediction, and early warning. So far, SHM has been widely used in many bridge structures, and a lot of bridge SHM data have also been collected. However, the existing studies usually focus on some independent and unsystematic analysis methods, which are hard to use widely in engineering applications to reveal the overall structural performance. This study focuses on the structural performance analysis and prediction of the highway in-service bridge. The dynamic problems in bridge SHM are pointed out firstly, followed by a detailed analysis about the characteristics of bridge SHM data. With the consideration of different characteristics, three targeted analysis methods are proposed. An urban concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) truss girder bridge (opened to traffic in 1995) is also presented, which once experienced some prominent vibration problems. The bridge SHM system is designed and stalled after several appearance inspections, load tests, and some reinforcement measures. The data mining methods proposed (distribution function, association analysis, and time-series analysis) are employed for the analysis and prediction of structural response and deterioration extent. This study can provide some references for maintenance and management and can also build a foundation for further online analysis and early warning.}

Structural health monitoring has the potential to make structures safer by observing both long-term structural changes and immediate postdisaster damage.

Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are denoted as one of the most promising sensors for SHM applications as they are lightweight, immune to electromagnetic effects and able to be embedded between the layers of composite structures. The purpose of this paper is to research on and demonstrate the feasibility of FBG sensors for SHM of composite structures.   Design/methodology/approach Applications on thin composite beams intended for SHM studies are presented. The sensor system, which includes FBG sensors and related interrogator system, and manufacturing of the beams with embedded sensors, are detailed. Static tension and torsion tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the system. Strain analysis results obtained from the tests are compared with the ones obtained from the finite element analyses conducted using ABAQUS® software. In addition, the comparison between the data obtained from the FBG sensors and from the strain gauges is made by also considering the noise content. Finally, fatigue test under torsion load is conducted to observe the durability of FBG sensors.   Findings The results demonstrated that FBG sensors are feasible for SHM of composite structures as the strain data are accurate and less noisy compared to that obtained from the strain gauges. Furthermore, the convenience of obtaining reliable data between the layers of a composite structure using embedded FBG sensors is observed.   Practical implications Observing the advantages of the FBG sensors for strain measurement will promote using FBG sensors for damage detection related to the SHM applications.   Originality/value This paper presents applications of FBG sensors on thin composite beams, which reveal the suitability of FBG sensors for SHM of lightweight composite structures.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {This paper discusses techniques for generating digital sequences of noise which simulate processes with certain known properties or describing equations. Part I of the paper presents a review of stochastic processes and spectral estimation (with some new results) and a tutorial on simulating continuous noise processes with a known autospectral density or autocorrelation function. In defining these techniques for computer generating sequences, it also defines the necessary accuracy criteria. These methods are compared to some of the common techniques for noise generation and the problems, or advantages, of each are discussed. Finally, Part I presents results on simulating stochastic differential equations. A Runge-Kutta (RK) method is presented for numerically solving these equations. Part II of the paper discusses power law, or 1/f/sup /spl alpha//, noises. Such noise processes occur frequently in nature and, in many cases, with nonintegral values for /spl alpha/. A review of 1/f noises in devices and systems is followed by a discussion of the most common continuous 1/f noise models. The paper then presents a new digital model for power law noises. This model allows for very accurate and efficient computer generation of 1/f/sup /spl alpha// noises for any /spl alpha/. Many of the statistical properties of this model are discussed and compared to the previous continuous models. Lastly, a number of approximate techniques for generating power law noises are presented for rapid or real time simulation.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Bridge structures are continuously subject to degradation due to the environment, ageing and excess loading. Periodic monitoring of bridges is therefore a key part of any maintenance strategy as it can give early warning if a bridge becomes unsafe. This article investigates an alternative method for the monitoring of bridge dynamic behaviour: a truck–trailer vehicle system, with accelerometers fitted to the axles of the trailer. The method aims to detect changes in the damping of a bridge, which may indicate the existence of damage. A simplified vehicle–bridge interaction model is used in theoretical simulations to assess the effectiveness of the method in detecting those changes. The influence of road profile roughness on the vehicle vibration is overcome by recording accelerations from both axles of a trailer and then analysing the spectra of the difference in the accelerations between the two axles. The effectiveness of the approach in detecting damage simulated as a loss in stiffness is also investigated. In addition, the sensitivity of the approach to the vehicle speed, road roughness class, bridge span length, changes in the equal axle properties and noise is investigated.},

Instead, this study will investigate adapting the impedance SHM method to rapidly evaluate a mechanical system during a dynamic event. Also in contrast to conventional SHM, the objective is not to detect damage but instead to detect changes in the boundary conditions as they occur during a dynamic event. Rapid detection of changes in boundary conditions in highly dynamic environments has the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications, including the aerospace, civil, and mining industries. A key feature of this work will be the use of frequency ranges higher than what is typically used for SHM impedance measurements, in the range of several MHz. Using such high frequencies will allow for faster measurements of impedance, thus enabling the capture of variations in boundary conditions as they change during a dynamic event. An existing analytical model from the literature for electromechanical impedance based SHM will be utilized for this study. © 2016 SPIE.},

  abstract = {Recently a number of high‐resolution techniques for event detection and parameter estimation (velocity) have emerged in the field of multichannel sonar array processing. We find that a practical and computationally efficient implementation of these methods is possible for seismic reflection data. This implementation results in development of the covariance measure for event detection and velocity estimation in seismic reflection data. The measure is based on the eigenstructure of the sampled data covariance matrix. This decomposition is carried out within hyperbolic windows that are moved through common‐depth‐point (CDP) data. Eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix allow simultaneous estimation of the noise and signal energy present within each window, resulting in the development of a coherency measure. Computer implementation of the covariance measure provides a high resolution method for determination of velocity spectra relative to currently used techniques. The method applied to synthetic data resolves reflections closely spaced in time and velocity as well as those with low signal‐to‐noise ratio (S/N). These results are also achieved when the method is applied to real data. The results in each case are directly compared to the widely used semblance measure. The covariance measure provides results superior to the crosscorrelation‐based semblance measure and offers a degree of resolution not previously attainable. These results can be achieved with a reduction in computational cost relative to semblance for typical analysis parameters. We find that the ability to continuously estimate noise energy, as well as signal energy, is critical to event resolution and noise rejection.}

  abstract = {Recent catastrophic bridge failures clearly indicate the urgent need for improving interval-based bridge inspection procedures that are qualitative and subjective in nature. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) can mitigate the deficiencies of interval-based inspection techniques and provide real-time diagnostic information regarding the bridge structural health. SHM is not flawless however; the variability in the vehicle characteristics and traffic operational conditions makes it prone to false diagnosis. Recent advancements in the integration of SHM with intelligent transportation systems (ITS) demonstrate the successful use of ITS devices (e.g., traffic cameras, traffic detectors) in the analysis of bridge responses to multimodal traffic with varying loads or during the critical events that cause excess vibration beyond the normal limit. In an ITS-informed SHM system, the ITS device collected data can be integrated with SHM to increase the reliability and accuracy of the SHM system. This integration would reduce the possibility of false diagnosis of damages detected by the SHM system (e.g., vibrations caused by heavy vehicles on a bridge could be read by a SHM sensor as a structural health problem of the bridge), which would eventually decrease the bridge maintenance costs. Similarly, in SHM-informed ITS system, SHM sensors can provide data on bridge health condition for ITS applications, where ITS uses this bridge health condition information for real-time traffic management. In this paper, literature related to both ITS-informed SHM and SHM-informed ITS is reviewed. Based on the literature review, potential challenges and future research directions associated with ITS-SHM integration are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A newly developed, completely contactless structural health monitoring system framework based on the use of regular cameras and computer vision techniques is introduced for obtaining displacements and vibrations of structures, which are critical responses for performance-based design and evaluation of structures. To provide contactless and practical monitoring, the current vision-based displacement measurement methods are improved by eliminating the physical target attachment. This is achieved by means of utilizing imaging key-points as virtual targets. As a result, pixel-based displacements of a monitored structural location are determined by using an improved detection and match key-points algorithm, in which false matches are identified and discarded almost completely. To transform pixel-based displacements to engineering units, a practical camera calibration method is developed because calibration standard on a physical target no longer exists. Moreover, a framework for evaluating the accuracy of vision-based displacement measurements is established for the first time, which, in return, provides users with the most crucial information of a measurement. The proposed framework along with a conventional sensor network and a data acquisition system are applied and verified on a real-life stadium during football games for structural assessment. The results obtained by the new method are successfully validated with the data acquired from sensors such as linear variable differential transformers and accelerometers. Because the proposed method does not require any type of sensor and target attachment, common field works such as sensor installation, wiring, maintaining conventional data acquisition systems are not required. This advantage enables an inexpensive and practical way for structural assessment, especially for real-life structures. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This is important to design high-performance and safety-critical battery systems. Moreover, the tuning parameters of the condition monitoring algorithms significantly influence the performance of the algorithms. This paper proposes a real-time model-based condition monitoring for Li-ion batteries based on a real-time second-order resistor–capacitor electrical circuit battery model. The proposed method consists of an extended Kalman filter based online parameter identification and a smooth variable structure filter based state estimation. The two filters are systematically integrated to cooperate with each other and named hybrid filter (HF). Furthermore, a proposed particle swarm optimization based tuning parameter optimization is employed to find the optimal tuning parameters of the HF. The proposed method is compared with the dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) via simulations and validated by experiments using a low-priced microcontroller. The results show that the proposed method can effectively choose the tuning parameters and has less computational complexity and higher accuracy of the SOC and capacity estimation than those of the conventional DEKF. Therefore, the proposed HF can be suitable for use in real-time embedded battery management system applications.}

Human inspection is the most commonly applied approach for fatigue crack detection, but is time consuming, labor intensive, and lacks reliability. In this study, we propose a computer vision-based fatigue crack detection approach using a short video stream taken by a consumer-grade digital camera. A feature tracking technology is applied to the video for tracking the surface motion of the monitored structure under repetitive load. Then, a crack detection and localization algorithm is established to effectively search differential features at different video frames caused by the crack opening and closing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through testing two experimental specimens with in-plane and out-of-plane fatigue cracks, respectively. Results indicate that the proposed approach can robustly identify the fatigue crack, even when the crack is under ambient lighting conditions, surrounded by other crack-like edges, covered by complex surface textures, or invisible to human eyes due to crack closure. Furthermore, our proposed approach enables accurate quantification of the crack opening under fatigue loading with submillimeter accuracy. However, due to the capacity of the camera resolution in this study, accurate detection of crack tip remains challenging. © 2018\hspace{0.6em}Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering}

Three experiments were carried out to investigate 1) long-term reliability of a low-cost GPS module for timestamping purpose, 2) accuracy of PPS signals itself and 3) accuracy of proposed time-stamping method. An Arduino Mega 2560 board with a 10MHz oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) was used in the experiment. It was found that the module was operated reliable for a week and accuracy of PPS signals were ±300 nano-sec, and maximum time-stamping error was within ±1 μsec which is very promising. Furthermore, a possible extension of the proposed system to time synchronization problem inside a building where no GPS signal available was investigated by utilizing the OCXO.},

Perfect time synchronization amongst the wireless sensors is a key factor enabling the use of low-cost, low-power WSNs for structural health monitoring applications based on output-only modal analysis of structures. In this paper we present a theoretical framework for analysis of the impact created by time delays in the measured system response on the reconstruction of mode shapes using the popular frequency domain decomposition (FDD) technique. This methodology directly estimates the change in mode shape values based on sensor synchronicity. We confirm the proposed theoretical model by experimental validation in modal identification experiments performed on an aluminum beam. The experimental validation was performed using a wireless intelligent sensor and actuator network (WISAN) which allows for close time synchronization between sensors (0.6-10 mu s in the tested configuration) and guarantees lossless data delivery under normal conditions. The experimental results closely match theoretical predictions and show that even very small delays in output response impact the mode shapes.},

  abstract = {So far, the inspection of building structures and especially of bridges is mainly done visually. Therefore, the condition of the structure is examined from the surface and the interpretation and assessment is based on the experience of the expert. However, the main purpose of monitoring civil structures is not to substitute visual inspection. Continuous structural health monitoring should provide data from the inside of a structure to better understand its structural performance and to predict its durability and remaining life time. Monitoring should render objective data and observable alterations in the structure continuously, which cannot be done by visual inspection. More detailed information is needed with respect to different exposure due to dynamic and static loads and also temperature and moisture. Today mainly wired monitoring systems are used to monitor structures, which are relatively expensive and time consuming to install. In this paper the basic principle of a wireless monitoring system equipped with MEMS sensors is presented, which can be easily installed at different structures. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are small integrated devices or systems that combine electrical and mechanical components. A wireless monitoring sensor network equipped with such MEMS could be produced with a very low budget and becomes very efficient. This permits a wide area of applications not only in civil engineering. With respect to different applications relevant properties of a wireless monitoring system are described. In detail network configuration, power consumption, data acquisition and data aggregation, signal analysis and data reduction as well as reliability and robustness are discussed.},

Energy is a major constraint for this network as the only source of energy is a battery with limited lifetime. Therefore, in order to keep the networks operating for long time, adaptive sampling approach to periodic data collection constitutes a fundamental mechanism for energy optimization. The key idea behind this approach is to allow each sensor node to adapt its sampling rates to the physical changing dynamics. In this way, over-sampling can be minimised and power efficiency of the overall network system can be further improved. In this paper, we present an efficient adaptive sampling approach based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time. Then, we propose a multiple levels activity model that uses behavior functions modeled by modified Bezier curves to define application classes and allow for sampling adaptive rate. The proposed method was successfully tested in a real sensor data set.},

The probabilistic distribution model and extreme value distribution of gross vehicle weight are statistically analysed using the monitoring data. The results indicate that they follow the bimodal lognormal and Gumbel distributions, respectively. The fatigue load spectrum is also studied. The logistic model is employed to predict the long-term traffic volume, and its parameters of the logistic model are updated using the monitored traffic volume.

Despite the number of applications, very few studies have been presented aimed at interpreting the data and at providing a means for detecting and localizing the insurgence of damage or material degradation from the measurements. The paper provides an approach to an algorithmic treatment of the data flows produced by continuous static monitoring systems. The proposed algorithm is the proper orthogonal decomposition(POD), a statistical method particularly suitable and versatile in multivariate analysis. However, its application in the field of damage detection for static monitoring is a new approach. The discussion will be based on data obtained by means of a computer simulation of a typical bridge structure subjected to environmental loadings. The POD will be used for studying a temporal and spatial correlation analysis between the structural responses measured at different sensor locations. The comparison in terms of damage indices of the responses from different sensors in time has been shown to be able to detect damaged sections. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Last decade, the need for wireless sensors solutions as core-solutions of Structural Monitoring gained in interest. The cost of wireless devices compared to the cost of wiring important structures (bridges, energy-plants, etc.) is attractive. Most of recent development in WSN domain focused on energy (saving or harvesting), on wireless proto-cols, on embedded algorithms. But it is a fact that, most of monitoring applications need samples to be time-stamped. According to the application, the wished time resolution could be up to one second for automation monitoring, one millisecond for vibration, one microsecond for acoustic monitoring, one nanosecond for electricity or light propagation... The consequence for a Wireless network of electronic nodes is that, by nature, no common signal could physically provide a synchronization top. But, as each electronic device, a wireless sensor time-base uses a timer incremented by a quartz whose initial value is theoretical up to some p.p.m. and whose period drift on time because of age, temperature, etc. Two kind of solutions could be regarded: a synchronization signal provided by the wireless protocol itself; an absolute synchronization from a referential source such as: GPS, Frankfurt clock, Galileo, etc. In the first way, it will be demonstrated the poor accuracy and the need of energy such a mechanism offers. In the second way, the article will details how a deterministic (Universal Time), accurate and resilient algorithm has been implemented. The article also provides specific results of application on acoustic monitoring system and electricity propagation where the accuracy of a WSN has reached up to 10 nanosecond UT. Consequence on energy consumption of this algorithm are given with a description of future works to improve the energy balance while keeping the device sober and synchronized.},

However, it is not easy to measure displacement of civil infrastructures, since the conventional sensors need a reference point, and inaccessibility to the reference point is sometimes caused by the geographic conditions, such as a highway or river under a bridge, which makes installation of measuring devices time-consuming and costly, if not impossible. To resolve this issue, a vision-based real-time displacement measurement system using digital image processing techniques is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified by comparing the load carrying capacities of a steel-plate girder bridge obtained from the conventional sensor and the present system. Further, to simultaneously measure multiple points, a synchronized vision-based system is developed using master/slave system with wireless data communication. For the purpose of verification, the measured displacement by a synchronized vision-based system was compared with the data measured by conventional contact-type sensors, linear variable differential transformers (LVDT) from a laboratory test.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Civil infrastructures experience long-term deflection as a result of persistent and transitory loadings, including self-weight, pre-stress, traffic, temperature variation, and stress redistributions due to damage. Thus, long-term displacement is an important safety indicator that can be widely employed in structural health monitoring. However, its measurement is challenging because of the errors induced by the ego-motion of sensors. Researchers have attempted to compensate for the motion-induced error in computer vision-based displacement measurement methods for full-scale civil structures by using fixed objects in the background. Because remotely located objects cannot fully provide six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) camera motions, further developments are necessary for complete error compensation. This paper proposes a long-term displacement measurement strategy that uses computer vision-based ego-motion compensation. The proposed system consists of main and sub-cameras attached to each other. While the main camera employs the conventional computer vision-based method for displacement measurement, the sub-camera measures the ego-motions of the dual-camera system from which the motion-induced errors are estimated and compensated for. The proposed long-term displacement measurement algorithm was numerically validated, and the sub-camera was found to provide a noticeable error compensation. A laboratory-scale test showed that the motion-induced error was reduced from 44.1~mm to 1.1~mm. A field application conducted upon a newly constructed railway bridge provided continuous long-term displacement measurement data, which were consistent with LiDAR-based displacement measurements and numerical predictions.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

However, direct use of images collected by aerial means to identify such defects is currently difficult because of obstructions caused by other objects in the image field of view. In this context, an automated rust-defect-determination method that leverages aerial imagery, including both visible and infrared images, is presented in this investigation. The proposed method consists of three steps. The first step deals with image registration for which a binary information method is proposed to match the infrared images to their visible counterparts. In the second step, bridge components are retrieved from the captured images via automated segmentation obtained by fusion of visible and infrared images.

  abstract = {The huge amounts of sensor data generated by large scale sensor networks in on-line structural health monitoring (SHM) systems often overwhelms the systems’ capacity for data transmission and analysis. This paper presents a new concept for an integrated SHM system in which a streamlined data flow is used as a unifying thread to integrate the individual components of on-line SHM systems. Such an integrated SHM system has a few desirable functionalities including embedded sensor data compression, interactive sensor data retrieval, and structural knowledge discovery, which aim to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and robustness of on-line SHM systems. Adoption of this new concept will enable the design of an on-line SHM system with more uniform data generation and data handling capacity for its subsystems. To examine this concept in the context of vibration-based SHM systems, real sensor data from an on-line SHM system comprising a scaled steel bridge structure and an on-line data acquisition system with remote data access was used in this study. Vibration test results clearly demonstrated the prominent performance characteristics of the proposed integrated SHM system including rapid data access, interactive data retrieval and knowledge discovery of structural conditions on a global level.},

  abstract = {Wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs) have shown great promise in structural health monitoring (SHM), because of their advantages of low cost, higher flexibility, robust data management, and ability to provide better understanding of structural behavior through dense deployment of sensors. However, implementation of wireless SHM systems poses many challenges, one of which is ensuring adequate synchronization of the collected data. This issue arises in WSSNs because each smart sensor in the network having an independent processor with its own local clock, and this clock is not necessarily synchronized with the clocks of other sensors. Moreover, even though the clocks can be accurately synchronized by exchanging time information through beacon messages, the measured data may still be poorly synchronized because of random delays from both software and hardware sources; that is, synchronized clocks do not necessarily yield synchronized sensing. Various algorithms have been proposed to achieve both synchronized clocks and sensing. However, these protocols still lack the desired performance for SHM applications for reasons of extended data collection time, temperature variations resulting in nonlinear clock drift, requirement for prompt response, and so on. In this paper, the unique features and challenges of synchronized sensing for SHM applications are discussed, followed by a numerical investigation of the effect of nonlinear clock drift on data synchronization accuracy. A new synchronized sensing strategy considering nonlinear clock drift compensation is proposed with two different implementations to meet various application requirements. Experimental results show that the proposed time synchronization approach can compensate for temperature effects on clock drift and provide efficient and accurately synchronized sensing ({$<$}50 µs maximum error) for SHM, even for long sensing duration.

  abstract = {This study proposes an information-theoretic structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on multi-scale entropy (MSE) and multi-scale cross-sample entropy (MSCE). By measuring the ambient vibration signal from a structure, the damage condition can be rapidly evaluated via MSE analysis. The damage location can then be detected by analyzing the signals of different floors under the same damage condition via MSCE analysis. Moreover, a damage index is proposed to efficiently quantify the SHM process. Unlike some existing SHM methods, no experimental database or numerical model is required. Instead, a reference measurement of the current stage can initiate and launch the SHM system. A numerical simulation of a four-story steel structure is used to verify that the damage location and condition can be detected by the proposed SHM algorithm, and the location can be efficiently quantified by the damage index. A seven-story scaled-down benchmark structure is then employed for experimental verification. Based on the results, the damage condition can be correctly assessed, and average accuracy rates of 63.4 and 86.6\% for the damage location can be achieved using the MSCE and damage index methods, respectively. As only the ambient vibration signal is required with a set of initial reference measurements, the proposed SHM system can be implemented practically with low cost.},

The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L1 -based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The alarmingly degrading state of transportation infrastructures combined with their key societal and economic importance calls for automatic condition assessment methods to facilitate smart management of maintenance and repairs. With the advent of ubiquitous sensing and communication capabilities, scalable data-driven approaches is of great interest, as it can utilize large volume of streaming data without requiring detailed physical models that can be inaccurate and computationally expensive to run. Properly designed, a data-driven methodology could enable fast and automatic evaluation of infrastructures, discovery of causal dependencies among various sub-system dynamic responses, and decision making with uncertainties and lack of labeled data. In this work, a spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) strategy built on symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) is proposed to explore spatiotemporal behaviors in a bridge network. Data from strain gauges installed on two bridges are generated using finite element simulation for three types of sensor networks from a density perspective (dense, nominal, sparse). Causal relationships among spatially distributed strain data streams are extracted and analyzed for vehicle identification and detection, and for localization of structural degradation in bridges. Multiple case studies show significant capabilities of the proposed approach in: (i) capturing spatiotemporal features to discover causality between bridges (geographically close), (ii) robustness to noise in data for feature extraction, (iii) detecting and localizing damage via comparison of bridge responses to similar vehicle loads, and (iv) implementing real-time health monitoring and decision making work flow for bridge networks. Also, the results demonstrate increased sensitivity in detecting damages and higher reliability in quantifying the damage level with increase in sensor network density.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We present a data-driven approach based on physical insights to achieve damage diagnosis of bridges using only vibration signals collected on board the vehicles passing over the bridge. Though data-driven models have been shown to produce promising results in this context, they generally require labeled examples to fit the models (i.e., supervised learning) and make it difficult to interpret the physical mechanisms. We posit that these shortcomings can be alleviated by studying the physical relationship between damage and the distribution of the resulting acceleration signals, and then choosing an appropriate model to invert this process. To help guide the development of appropriate damage diagnosis algorithms, we first make use of the theoretical formulation of the vehicle-bridge interaction system in the frequency domain and conduct a finite element simulation of this system. From the derived numerical solution, we observe that not only is the trend of the acceleration signals of a passing vehicle with different damage severity non-linear, but also that both the low- and high-frequency responses of a passing vehicle contain information about damage severity. Guided by these observations, we use several dimensionality reduction methods to extract representative features from the vehicle's vibration response. We then propose an unsupervised damage severity comparison model and a semi-supervised damage severity estimation model aiming at indirect monitoring of bridges. We apply the algorithms to diagnose changes that occur in a laboratory bridge model to which a concentrated mass of gradually changing magnitude is attached at mid-span. The experimental results of the damage severity comparison and estimation show that a non-convex and non-linear dimensionality reduction technique (stacked autoencoders) outperforms other linear and/or convex dimensionality reduction techniques. Overall, our results provide evidence for the applicability of indirect structural health monitoring in bridge models and suggest the feasibility of extending this approach to actual structures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this paper, we present an algorithm that can classify vehicles passing by a loop detector into two categories: long vehicles and regular cars. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of event-based loop detector data that contains every vehicle detector actuation and de-actuation “event”, therefore time gaps between consecutive vehicles and detector occupation time for each vehicle can be easily derived. The proposed algorithm is based on an intuitive observation that, for a vehicle platoon, longer vehicles in the platoon will have relatively longer detector occupation time. Therefore, we can identify longer vehicles by examining the changes of occupation time in a vehicle platoon. The method was tested using the event-based data collected from Trunk Highway 55 in Minnesota, which is a high speed arterial corridor controlled by semi-actuated coordinated traffic signals. The result shows that the proposed method can correctly classify most of the vehicles passing by a single loop detector.},

Two pieces of two models of triaxial accelerometers (ADXL 330 and ADXL 327 by Analog Devices Inc.) with analog outputs were tested within a period of ca. 4.5 years. Two different computer-controlled test rigs were used for performing relevant experimental studies, employing tilt angles as the reference source. Methodology of determining the proposed indicators of aging was based on cyclic repetition of the calibration procedure for each accelerometer. Changes of the output signals of the tested accelerometers were observed, resulting in respective indication errors of ca. 0.8\% or even 2.2\% while related to determining tilt. Since the accelerometers were operated under mild conditions while tested, much bigger errors are to be expected in the case of harsh conditions. Both pieces of ADXL 330 accelerometers ceased to operate properly within the testing period, approximately at the same time, for no apparent reason; thus, it is recommended to introduce redundancy in relevant reliable measuring circuits by doubling the number of the applied accelerometers.},

By undertaking a series of tests, coupled with dynamic loading, the performance of fiber Bragg grating-based sensor systems with various amplification techniques were investigated. In recent years, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have been developed to monitor bridge deterioration, to assess load levels and hence extend bridge life and safety. Conventional SHM systems, based on measuring strain, can be used to improve knowledge of the bridge’s capacity to resist loads but generally give no information on the causes of any increase in stresses. Therefore, it is necessary to find accurate sensors capable of capturing peak strains under dynamic load and suitable methods for attaching these strain sensors to existing and new bridge structures. Additionally, it is important to ensure accurate strain transfer between concrete and steel, adhesives layer, and strain sensor. The results show the benefits in the use of optical fiber networks under these circumstances and their ability to deliver data when conventional sensors cannot capture accurate strains and/or peak strains.},

  abstract = {This paper describes development of a contactless, low cost vision-based system for displacement measurement of civil structures. Displacement measurements provide a valuable insight into the structural condition and service behaviour of bridges under live loading. Conventional displacement gauges or GPS based systems have limitations in terms of access to the infrastructure and accuracy. The system introduced in this paper provides a low cost durable alternative which is rapidly deployable in the field and does not require direct contact or access to the infrastructure or its vicinity. A commercial action camera was modified to facilitate the use of a telescopic lens and paired with the development of robust displacement identification algorithms based on pattern matching. Performance was evaluated first in a series of controlled laboratory tests and validated against displacement measurements obtained using a fibre optic displacement gauge. The efficiency of the system for field applications was then demonstrated by capturing the validated bridge response of two structures under live loading including the iconic peace bridge. Located in the City of Derry, Northern Ireland, the Peace Bridge is a 310 m curved self-anchored suspension pedestrian bridge structure. The vision-based results of the field experiment were confirmed against displacements calculated from measured accelerations during a dynamic assessment of the structure under crowd loading. In field applications the developed system can achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 mm against verified measurements.},

  abstract = {Globally road transport networks are subjected to continuous levels of stress from increasing loading and environmental effects. As the most popular mean of transport in the UK the condition of this civil infrastructure is a key indicator of economic growth and productivity. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems can provide a valuable insight to the true condition of our aging infrastructure. In particular, monitoring of the displacement of a bridge structure under live loading can provide an accurate descriptor of bridge condition. In the past B-WIM systems have been used to collect traffic data and hence provide an indicator of bridge condition, however the use of such systems can be restricted by bridge type, assess issues and cost limitations. This research provides a non-contact low cost AI based solution for vehicle classification and associated bridge displacement using computer vision methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been adapted to develop the QUBYOLO vehicle classification method from recorded traffic images. This vehicle classification was then accurately related to the corresponding bridge response obtained under live loading using non-contact methods. The successful identification of multiple vehicle types during field testing has shown that QUBYOLO is suitable for the fine-grained vehicle classification required to identify applied load to a bridge structure. The process of displacement analysis and vehicle classification for the purposes of load identification which was used in this research adds to the body of knowledge on the monitoring of existing bridge structures, particularly long span bridges, and establishes the significant potential of computer vision and Deep Learning to provide dependable results on the real response of our infrastructure to existing and potential increased loading.},

  abstract = {Vehicle detection and classification have become important tasks for traffic monitoring, transportation management and pavement evaluation. Nowadays there are sensors to detect and classify the vehicles on road. However, on one hand, most sensors rely on direct contact measurement to detect the vehicles, which have to interrupt the traffic. On the other hand, complex road scenes produce much noise to consider when to process the signals. In this paper, a data-driven methodology for the detection and classification of vehicles using strain data is proposed. The sensors are well arranged under the bridge deck without traffic interruption. Next, a cascade pre-processing method is applied for vehicle detection to eliminate in-situ noise. Then, a neural network model is trained to identify the close-range following vehicles and separate them by Non-Maximum Suppression. Finally, a deep convolutional neural network is designed and trained to identify the vehicle types based on the axle group. The methodology was applied in a long-span bridge. Three strain sensors were installed beneath the bridge deck for a week. High robustness and accuracy were obtained by these algorithms. The methodology proposed in this paper is an adaptive and promising method for vehicle detection and classification under complex noise. It would serve as a supplement to current transportation systems and provide reliable data for management and decision-making.},

This distribution could be a new one that the user is curious about, or a known distribution from an existing histogram visualization. At present, this process of identification is brute-force, requiring the manual generation and evaluation of a large number of histograms. We present FastMatch: an end-to-end approach for interactively retrieving the histogram visualizations most similar to a user-specified target, from a large collection of histograms. The primary technical contribution underlying FastMatch is a probabilistic algorithm, HistSim, a theoretically sound sampling-based approach to identify the top-k closest histograms under ℓ1 distance. While HistSim can be used independently, within FastMatch we couple HistSim with a novel system architecture that is aware of practical considerations, employing asynchronous block-based sampling policies. FastMatch obtains near-perfect accuracy with up to 35× speedup over approaches that do not use sampling on several real-world datasets.},

The implementation of algorithms to perform the continuous on-line identification of modal parameters based on structural responses to ambient excitation (automated Operational Modal Analysis) has permitted to create a very complete database with the time evolution of the bridge modal characteristics during more than 2 years. This paper describes the strategy that was followed to minimize the effects of environmental and operational factors on the bridge natural frequencies, enabling, in a subsequent stage, the identification of structural anomalies. Alternative static and dynamic regression models are tested and complemented by a Principal Components Analysis. Afterwards, the identification of damages is tried with control charts. At the end, it is demonstrated that the adopted processing methodology permits the detection of realistic damage scenarios, associated with frequency shifts around 0.2\%, which were simulated with a numerical model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we focused on the development and verification of a solid and robust framework for structural condition assessment of real-life structures using measured vibration responses, with the presence of multiple progressive damages occurring within the inspected structures. A self-tuning learning method for structural condition assessment was proposed. Damage sensitive features were extracted using a frequency domain decomposition (FDD) approach to fuse all the measured responses, followed by random projection algorithm for dimensionality reduction. An automatic parameter selection method called Appropriate Distance to the Enclosing Surface (ADES) was used for tuning the classifier parameter. The effect of operational conditions on the robustness of the proposed method was also investigated, and it was realized that application of FDD to extract damage sensitive feature reduces the variation in the results. Promising results in the assessment of damage were obtained based on two comprehensive case studies, which included single and multiple damage scenarios. The contributions of the work are threefold. First, through two comprehensive case studies, we demonstrate that the frequency-based feature from a single sensor might not be adequate enough to detect the progress of damage, even if the sensor is in the vicinity of damage. Second, we show that data fusion using FDD can reliably assess the severity of damage, and finally, we propose a new automated approach for tuning the classifier parameter.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new two-stage machine learning approach for bridge damage detection using the responses measured on a passing vehicle. In the first stage, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using the vehicle responses measured from multiple passes (training data set) over a healthy bridge. The vehicle acceleration or Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) spectrum of the acceleration is used. The vehicle response is predicted from its speed for multiple passes (monitoring data set) over the bridge. Root-mean-square error is used to calculate the prediction error, which indicates the differences between the predicted and measured responses for each passage. In the second stage of the proposed method, a damage indicator is defined using a Gaussian process that detects the changes in the distribution of the prediction errors. It is suggested that if the bridge condition is healthy, the distribution of the prediction errors will remain low. A recognizable change in the distribution might indicate a damage in the bridge. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using numerical case studies of vehicle–bridge interaction. It was demonstrated that the approach could successfully detect the damage in the presence of road roughness profile and measurement noise, even for low damage levels.}

  abstract = {Train wheelset is an important part of the train. After long-time and high load working, fatigue damage will appear. Then the micro-cracks will form and expand into macro cracks, which may cause a serious accident. Therefore, it is necessary to study the fatigue damage detection methods for train wheelset. Fatigue damage will cause nonlinear effects. The Nonlinear Output Frequency Response Functions (NOFRFs) is an effective tool to characterize the nonlinearity of the system. In this paper, based on the concept of Kull Back-Leibler (KL) divergence and NOFRFs, a detection method denoted as NOFRFs-KL (NKL) is proposed to study the feasibility of comprehensively evaluate the fatigue damage of wheelset. The train wheelset is considered as a single input multiple output (SIMO) nonlinear system while hammering on one point in the hammering test. And the estimated NOFRFs of multiple positions in the SIMO system are used to evaluate the fatigue damage at each output position. To verify the effectiveness of the NKL, some hammering tests are carried out. The NOFRFs of the wheelsets with micro-cracks, repaired wheelsets are calculated. The NOFRFs of the wheelsets with different served time are calculated. And then the corresponding NKL values are obtained. The results show that the fatigue damage in the wheelsets can be identified by the NKL index, and the NKL index can be proportional to the service time of the wheelset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The dynamic characteristics of Sutong Cable-Stayed Bridge (SCB), including acceleration and strain responses as well as modal frequencies, are investigated using one-year continuous monitoring data under operating conditions by the structural health monitoring system. The in situ wind characteristics and structural temperature behavior of SCB are also analyzed. More than 99\% of the wind speed values are smaller than 16~m/s; and the largest temperature variation of the main girder exceeds 60~°C. Besides, acceleration and strain, root mean square (RMS) data are both normalized using the Z-score standardization method. Relation analysis between the normalized acceleration and strain RMS values is conducted based on the time-history comparison and linear least square fitting. Results show that both of the processed acceleration and strain RMS values could properly describe the variation trend of the traffic load, although variation amplitudes of the two normalized parameters differ from each other. In addition, one-year continuous modal frequencies of SCB are identified using Hilbert–Huang transform method. Variability analysis of the structural modal frequencies due to environmental temperature and operational traffics is then conducted. Results show that temperature is the most important environmental factor for vertical and torsional modal frequencies. The traffic load is the second critical factor especially for the fundamental vertical frequency of SCB. Research results could provide references for damage detection and safety evaluation for similar long-span cable-stayed bridges. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Beginning with the assumption that the reader has never seen a matrix before, the authors go on to provide a survey of a substantial part of the field, including many areas of modern research interest. Part One of the book covers not only the standard ideas of matrix theory, but ones, as the authors state, \&quot;that reflect our own prejudices,\&quot; among them Kronecker products, compound and induced matrices, quadratic relations, permanents, incidence matrices and generalizations of commutativity. Part Two begins with a survey of elementary properties of convex sets and polyhedra and presents a proof of the Birkhoff theorem on doubly stochastic matrices. This is followed by a discussion of the properties of convex functions and a list of classical inequalities. This material is then combined to yield many of the interesting matrix inequalities of Weyl, Fan, Kantorovich and others. The treatment is along the lines developed by these authors and their successors and many of their proofs are included. This chapter contains an account of the classical Perron Frobenius-Wielandt theory of indecomposable nonnegative matrices and ends with some important results on stochastic matrices. Part Three is concerned with a variety of results on the localization of the characteristic roots of a matrix in terms of simple functions of its entries or of entries of a related matrix. The presentation is essentially in historical order, and out of the vast number of results in this field the authors have culled those that seemed most interesting or useful. Readers will find many of the proofs of classical theorems and a substantial number of proofs of results in contemporary research literature.},

Eight sensors are simulated at different locations on the vehicle. It is assumed that measured deflections are absolute, i.e. they have been corrected for vehicle motion and that the characteristics of the vehicle are known. The unit load theorem is used to relate the measured deflections to the reciprocals of flexural rigidity at every location on the bridge. A Blackman window filter is used to regularise the problem and to improve the conditioning of an ill-conditioned system of equations. In addition, a moving average filter is used to reduce the influence of noise and dynamics, which are sources of inaccuracy in this study.

  abstract = {System identification algorithms currently require a full data set, i.e., no missing observations, to estimate the natural vibration properties of a structural system. These algorithms are often based on parameters estimated from a state-space model. There are circumstances in which a Missing Data Problem can arise during data collection; therefore, it is important to adjust these algorithms to facilitate Structural Modal Identification. Despite having missing observations, state-space parameters can be estimated for a time series; subsequently, structural modal properties can be identified. This paper will use the EM algorithm to identify structural modal properties from a data set with missing observations. The end of the paper will focus on the search for a missingness threshold which can be used to assess the probability of extracting useful structural modal properties from a given data set with missing observations. This assessment will be based on the accuracy of modal estimates for data sets with varying magnitudes and patterns of missingness. It is clear that missingness can only reduce the accuracy of modal estimates; however, it is important to establish the associated scale and behavior of the reduction. An example is presented to illustrate the main concepts of this approach. © 2013 SPIE.},

It is shown that the algorithm is capable of learning the normal response of the structure and provides effective means of identifying novel features in the sensor record thereafter. This permits further detailed study of these specific noteworthy events. Events are identified using a relative novelty index computed by the neural network architecture.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A novel substructural damage detection approach based on auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model and optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) distance is proposed to locate and quantify the damages. Firstly, the shear structure is divided into independent substructures so that damage identification can be performed on each substructure modeling with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model, which is promising for practical application and distributed structural health monitoring. Compared with the auto-regressive (AR) model, the ARMAX model structure involves not only the outputs but also the inputs and the disturbance dynamics, which help to improve the performance of modeling every substructure and gain the flexibility to handle the disturbance caused by environmental noises even the structural responses contain strong correlations under different excitations. The features of a linear dynamic system can be represented by its poles estimated from ARMAX model, transforming the damage detection into multi-target tracking of system poles. The OSPA distance is used as an innovative damage indicator of a function of the ARMAX model poles in this study, and is calculated by Hungarian algorithm. Experimental verifications were conducted to prove satisfactory damage detection. The application on nonlinear damage identification in a complex three-dimensional reinforced concrete structure shows the great potential of the proposed pole-based OSPA distance in multi-sensor information fusion of structural responses from different directions.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a relatively new branch of civil engineering that focuses on assessing the health status of infrastructure, such as long-span bridges. Using a broad range of in-situ monitoring instruments, the purpose of the SHM is to help engineers understand the behaviour of structures, ensuring their structural integrity and the safety of the public. Under the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) scheme of the European Space Agency (ESA), a feasibility study (FS) project that used the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Earth Observation (EO) for Structural Health Monitoring of Long-span Bridges (GeoSHM) was initiated in 2013. The GeoSHM FS Project was led by University of Nottingham and the Forth Road Bridge (Scotland, UK), which is a 2.5 km long suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth connecting Edinburgh and the Northern part of Scotland, was selected as the test structure for the GeoSHM FS project. Initial results have shown the significant potential of the GNSS and EO technologies. With these successes, the FS project was further extended to the demonstration stage, which is called the GeoSHM Demo project where two other long-span bridges in China were included as test structures. Led by UbiPOS UK Ltd. (Nottingham, UK), a Nottingham Hi-tech company, this stage focuses on addressing limitations identified during the feasibility study and developing an innovative data strategy to process, store, and interpret monitoring data. This paper will present an overview of the motivation and challenges of the GeoSHM Demo Project, a description of the software and hardware architecture and a discussion of some primary results that were obtained in the last three years.},

  abstract = {Health monitoring systems set up to assure the safe operation of structures require linking sensors with computational tools able to interpret sensor data in terms of structural performance. Although intensive development continues on innovative sensor systems, there is still considerable uncertainty in deciding on the number of sensors required and their location in order to obtain adequate information on structural behaviour. This paper considers the problem of locating sensors on a bridge structure with the aim of maximizing the data information so that structural dynamic behaviour can be fully characterised. Six different optimal sensor placement techniques, three based on the maximisation of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), one on the properties of the covariance matrix coefficients, and two on energetic approaches, have been investigated. Mode shape displacements were taken as the measured data set and two comparison criteria were employed. The first criterion was based on the mean square error between the FE model and the cubic spline interpolated mode shapes. The second criterion measured the information content of each sensor location to investigate on the strength of the acquired signals and their ability to withstand the noise pollution keeping intact the information relative to the structure properties. The results showed that the effective independence driving-point residue (EFI-DPR) method provides an effective method for optimal sensor placement to identify the vibration characteristics of the studied bridge. The variance method (VM) developed by the authors gave results very close to the EFI-DPR technique, in terms of the capability to capture the vibration mode shape and signal strength. However, the VM presented unique characteristics in the world of the OSP techniques, which is the indication of the optimal number of sensors (ONS).},

  abstract = {Event-based systems are a class of reactive systems deployed in a wide spectrum of engineering disciplines including control, communication, signal processing, and electronic instrumentation. Activities in event-based systems are triggered in response to events usually representing a significant change of the state of controlled or monitored physical variables. Event-based systems adopt a model of calls for resources only if it is necessary, and therefore, they are characterized by efficient utilization of communication bandwidth, computation capability, and energy budget. Currently, the economical use of constrained technical resources is a critical issue in various application domains because many systems become increasingly networked, wireless, and spatially distributed. Event-Based Control and Signal Processing examines the event-based paradigm in control, communication, and signal processing, with a focus on implementation in networked sensor and control systems. Featuring 23 chapters contributed by more than 60 leading researchers from around the world, this book covers:   Methods of analysis and design of event-based control and signal processing Event-driven control and optimization of hybrid systems Decentralized event-triggered control Periodic event-triggered control Model-based event-triggered control and event-triggered generalized predictive control Event-based intermittent control in man and machine Event-based PID controllers Event-based state estimation Self-triggered and team-triggered control Event-triggered and time-triggered real-time architectures for embedded systems Event-based continuous-time signal acquisition and DSP Statistical event-based signal processing in distributed detection and estimation Asynchronous spike event coding technique with address event representation Event-based processing of non-stationary signals Event-based digital (FIR and IIR) filters Event-based local bandwidth estimation and signal reconstruction  Event-Based Control and Signal Processing is the first extensive study on both event-based control and event-based signal processing, presenting scientific contributions at the cutting edge of modern science and engineering.},

Adoption of the microprocessor field data collector/analyzer, the PC for automated monitoring, diagnostics and information management combined with major improvements in electronics and signal processing technology have greatly advanced the ability to assess condition, detect and diagnose anomalies. It is almost beyond belief that today's portable data collectors have greater functionality and performance than an entire truckload of laboratory analysis instrumentation less than twenty-five years ago! Today, the earliest stages of most flaws can be recognized in ample time to minimize the impact on production and avoid outright failure.

Current bridge inspection and rating practices recommend observing bridge movements under a live load to help assess bridge conditions. However, measuring bridge movements under trains in the field is a challenging task. Even when they are measured, the relationships between bridge displacements and different loads/speeds are generally unknown. The research reported herein shows the effects of known train loadings, speeds, and traffic directions on the magnitude and frequency of displacements as measured on timber pile bents of a Class I railroad bridge. Researchers collected both vertical and transverse (lateral) displacements under revenue service traffic and work trains using LVDTs with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. To investigate the effect of traffic on timber railroad bridges, displacements were measured under crossing events at different speeds and directions of a test train of known speed and weight provided by the railroad for the field experiment. The results indicate that bridge transverse displacements could help to capture critical changes in timber railroad bridge serviceability (i.e., ability to safely carry out railroad operations) as a function of railroad loading, speed, and direction.

Consequently, railroad companies are currently looking into developing and exploring monitoring systems for specific bridges, to help them improve and develop bridge safety in order to help comply with this new rule.

The new rule comes from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and it falls under the 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 213 and 237 1. It requires railroad track owners to know the safe capacity of their bridges and to additionally conduct special inspections if either weather or other exceptional conditions make them necessary to ensure safe railroad bridge operations. The second part of this paper will cover past and current studies about the viability of bridge health monitoring, and actual structural monitoring experiences for railroad bridges.

A critical portion of the railroad infrastructure is the more than 100,000 bridges, which occur, on the average, every 1.4 miles of track. Railroads have a limited budget for capital investment. Therefore, decisions on which bridges to repair/replace become critical for both safety and economy. North American railroads regularly inspected bridges to ensure safe operation that can meet transport demands, using inspection reports to decide which bridges may need maintenance, replacement, or further investigation. Current bridge inspection practices recommend observing bridge responses under live load to help assess bridge condition. However, measuring bridge responses under train loads in the field is a challenging, expensive, and complex task. This research explores the potential of using wireless smart sensors (WSS) to measure bridge responses under revenue service traffic that can be used to inform bridge management decisions. Wireless strain gages installed on the rail measure real-time train loads. Wireless accelerometers and magnetic strain gages installed in the bridge measure associated bridge responses. The system is deployed and validated on a double-track steel truss bridge on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, owned by the Canadian National Railway. A calibrated finite element model of the bridge with known train input load estimated the responses of the bridge at arbitrary, unmeasured locations, showing the possibility of applying the system for decision making process. These results demonstrate the potential of WSS technology to assist with railroad bridge inspection and management practice. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

In recent decades, countries have developed codes and standards for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). During this same period, rapid growth in the Chinese economy has led to massive development of civil engineering infrastructure design and construction projects. Consequently, China has become the leading country of civil engineering. In 2016, the Ministry of Transportation of the People’s Republic of China published a new design code for SHM systems for large highway bridges. This document is the first technical SHM code by a national government that enforces sensor installation on highway bridges. This paper summarizes the existing international technical SHM codes for various countries and compares them with the new SHM code required by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation. The paper outlines the contents of the new Chinese SHM code and explains its relevance for the safety and management of large bridges in China, introducing key Chinese-US SHM vocabulary, definitions and technical significance. Finally, this paper discusses the implications for the design and implementation of a future US SHM code, with suggestions for similar efforts in other countries and governments.},

  abstract = {A redundant system of collocated geodetic sensors and an accelerometer were used to measure the displacements of a stiff, 40-m-long footbridge excited by essentially vertical synchronized jumps. A main output of the measurements was that excitations produced vertical deflections (of the order of several mm), lateral deflections with an amplitude about half that of the vertical, an effect known for various bridges, and also smaller-scale longitudinal deflections, probably induced by the vertical ones. This combination of deflections in three axes is not an artifact of measuring errors, or of limitations of specific instruments, and do not reflect random effects, for they have been observed in different experiments by different sensors (Global Navigation Satellite System-GNSS, i.e., Global Positioning System-GPS plus the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System-GLONASS), robotic total stations-RTS (or robotic theodolite), and an accelerometer, and were tested through control of the measurement errors from time series reflecting no bridge oscillations. In all cases, sensors provided similar estimates of deflections and of deflection-derived dominant frequencies, which were found equal to those derived from the accelerometer. The proposed instrumentation and methodology seem suitable to control deflections of bridges in cases that visibility of satellites is poor or is disrupted by vehicle circulation. Measurement-based modeling of bridges described might be useful for understanding the structural behavior of bridges under several types of dynamic loads and can contribute to the displacement-based design of structures. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Continuous monitoring of structural vibrations is becoming increasingly common as interest in structural health monitoring (SHM) grows, as equipment becomes more affordable, and as system and damage identification methods develop. In vibration-based SHM, the dynamic modal parameters of a structure may be used as damage-sensitive features. The modal parameters are often sensitive to changes in temperature or other environmental effects, so continuous monitoring systems must also measure environmental conditions. Necessary components of a continuous structural monitoring system include a well-designed sensor array, data acquisition and logging equipment, data transfer and storage functions, and routines for extracting modal parameters from vibration measurements. All processes must be automated to handle the large volume of data generated. Such a monitoring system has been installed on the Dowling Hall Footbridge at Tufts University and is currently providing live data for research in vibration-based SHM. This paper focuses on (1) the design and installation of the system hardware and (2) the strategy used to automate the monitoring system. Successful automation of modal analysis is emphasized as the key component of this strategy. To highlight the system’s capabilities, the pattern of variation of the natural frequencies is examined and compared with environmental data.},

  abstract = {The concept of structural health monitoring has been the subject of research over the last few years, particularly in civil and structural engineering where ageing infrastructure is of major concern. These studies have led to initiatives towards the development and deployment of new sensing technologies. Owing to the harsh environments found in the construction industry, and the large size of civil engineering structures, such sensors should be robust, rugged, easy to use and economical. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors offer a viable such sensing approach with a number of advantages over traditional sensors. These include immunity to electromagnetic interference, light weight, small size, multiplexing capabilities, ease of installation and durability. This paper reports some results from a multi-disciplinary research program on FBG sensors involving the School of Civil and Structural Engineering and the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Novel FBG strain sensors have been developed and deployed on highway bridges to measure dynamic strain, static strain, and temperature. Results of these studies indicate that, if properly packaged, FBG sensors can survive the severe conditions associated with the construction environments of civil infrastructure. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This article addresses a novel approach to diagnose a structure's damage based on changes in the mechanical parameters of materials. Firstly, we integrate a viscoelastic model into structural damage detection and diagnosis. Accordingly, this model defines materials' mechanical characteristics via two parameters namely elastic module ({$<$}em{$>$}E{$<$}/em{$>$}) and viscous coefficient ({$<$}em{$>$}C\textsubscript{0}{$<$}/em{$>$}). While Hooke's model is linear, the viscoelastic is non-linear, and therefore, it reflects real situation more precisely. Secondly, we exploit amplitude and frequency of vibration signals and determines their relation with mechanical parameters in detecting structural changes. Based on theoretical analysis and experimental results, our study reveals more effective and general than previous ones. The simultaneous monitoring of structural change using different parameters allow the research to collect more appropriate data compared to previous studies. The results derived from this research were adopted in monitoring health of Saigon bridge over the period of 15~years. Via more than 100 sensors permanently attached to the bridge, the measured signals enabled the evaluation of the structure's operation status. This experimental result shows suitability among the proposed theoretical approaches, and thereby forms a basis to forecast damages of complex structures.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

This paper examines the generalization capability of neural network models, established using long-term monitoring data, for correlation between the modal frequencies and environmental temperatures. A total of 770 h modal frequency and temperature data obtained from an instrumented bridge are available for this study, which are further divided into three sets: training data, validation data, and testing data. A two-layer back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is first trained using the training data by the conventional training algorithm, in which the number of hidden nodes is optimally determined using the validation data. Then two new BPNNs are configured with the same data by applying the early stopping technique and the Bayesian regularization technique, respectively. The reproduction and prediction capabilities of the two new BPNNs are examined in respect of the training data and the unseen testing data, and compared with the performance of the baseline BPNN model. This study indicates that both the early stopping and Bayesian regularization techniques can significantly ameliorate the generalization capability of BPNN-based correlation models, and the BPNN model formulated using the early stopping technique outperforms that using the Bayesian regularization technique in both reproduction and prediction capabilities.},

  abstract = {A novel damage detection approach using only two sensors to detect the damage in beam bridges subjected to a moving vehicle is proposed in this article. In this approach, a moving mass is considered representing a vehicle moving across the bridge, and structural vibration responses at two locations are measured from a pair of sensors. A moving window is defined with a certain length determined by the sampling frequency and the fundamental frequency of the measured responses. The windowed pair time series extracted from these two measured responses are used to calculate the cross-correlation, which is used to define the local damage index. A simply supported beam bridge subjected to a moving mass is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach can accurately identify the single and multiple damages using both displacement and acceleration responses, even when the responses are smeared with a significant noise. This indicates a good robustness to the noise effect. Experimental verifications on a laboratory beam bridge model demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully identify the damage location using different selections of sensor pairs. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the new damage index is a good candidate for structural damage detection with very limited measurement information.},

The possible sources of errors in the acquired data were first considered on the basis of the principle of the FBG sensor and the details of the installation of system components: FBGs, cables, epoxy, FBG interrogator, and data acquisition system. The data reliability was first evaluated by a defined measure: the availability ratio of FBG peak wavelengths throughout the period of 2012-2014. It was then said that the high reliabilities of the FBG interrogator and data acquisition system were ensured; however, reliability reduction was observed in some FBGs. The stability was also evaluated on the basis of the accuracy and sensitivity. A characteristic disturbance in the data accuracy, which is the standard deviation of the acquired FBG peak wavelength, was recognized only in specific FBGs. Moreover, the attachment condition issues in some FBGs were also recognized by sensitivity analyses.

  abstract = {Abs tract—Energy efficient sensor nodes are among the rapidly expanding applications for embedded systems technology. Typically, the processing resources in sensor nodes are based on programmable micro-controllers and digital signal processors, and the same processing architecture is used regardless of the actual task of the node. This regularly results in at least an order of magnitude over-provisioning of resources, and in higher power consumption than would be needed by tightly application specific processing solutions. Currently, experiments show that Flash FPGA technology enables implementing precisely provisioned processing for sensor nodes with energy efficiency that rivals off-the-shelf processor solutions. The expected competitiveness originates from savings in silicon real-estate, and lowered software overheads, as inherently parallel tasks can be offloaded to dedicated hardware accelerators on the same die with a microcontroller unit, and radio baseband. The results pave the way for a novel type of self-powered sensor nodes whose processing resources are configured according to their tasks. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are expected to become the backbone for ubiquitous computing, and their projected application area is constantly growing. They have been envisioned to perform tasks such as climate monitoring, electric motor supervision, belt tension sensing and vibration sensing. The purposes to which the low cost, even expendable WSNs are expected to be deployed vary from burning hot steel production processes to freezing-cold outdoor environmental monitoring. The huge range of application areas and environments also define a wide range of requirements for the WSNs, that are difficult to meet with a single fixed design. These include not only the environmental specifications, but also significantly disparate computational performance demands, and low power operation, even at zero power relying on energy harvested from the operating environment. The impact of the requirements on the feasibility of implementation technologies is substantial. A typical low cost wireless sensor node is illustrated in Fig. 1. A signal processor, micro-controller unit, and radio transceiver are used to implement the processing, control, and communications functionalities, respectively. In addition, the WSN has a power supply that harnesses energy from a battery, or an energy harvesting unit. The multiple sensors and measurement channels may come from the application needs, such as disturbance cancellation to dig up the signal of interest. Multiple sensors may also be employed to compensate for the mediocre performance of the low cost sensors, and even to provide for redundancy needed in simple self-diagnostics.},

The bridge is represented by a finite element (FE) model. A Half-car model is used to represent the passing vehicle. Damage is represented as a local loss of stiffness in different parts of the bridge. 1\% random noise and no noise environments are considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

  abstract = {Bridge Weigh-in-Motion (B-WIM) systems use the bridge response under a traversing vehicle to estimate its axle weights. The information obtained from B-WIM systems has been used for a wide range of applications such as pre-selection for weight enforcement, traffic management/planning and for bridge and pavement design. However, it is less often used for bridge condition assessment purposes which is the main focus of this study. This paper presents a bridge damage detection concept using information provided by B-WIM systems. However, conventional B-WIM systems use strain measurements which are not sensitive to local damage. In this paper the authors present a B-WIM formulation that uses rotation measurements obtained at the bridge supports. There is a linear relationship between support rotation and axle weight and, unlike strain, rotation is sensitive to damage anywhere in the bridge. Initially, the sensitivity of rotation to damage is investigated using a hypothetical simply supported bridge model. Having seen that rotation is damage-sensitive, the influence of bridge damage on weight predictions is analysed. It is shown that if damage occurs, a rotation-based B-WIM system will continuously overestimate the weight of traversing vehicles. Finally, the statistical repeatability of ambient traffic is studied using real traffic data obtained from a Weigh-in-Motion site in the U.S. under the Federal Highway Administration’s Long-Term Pavement Performance programme and a damage indicator is proposed as the change in the mean weights of ambient traffic data. To test the robustness of the proposed damage detection methodology numerical analysis are carried out on a simply supported bridge model and results are presented within the scope of this study.},

  abstract = {The goal of structural health monitoring is to provide reliable information regarding damage states that include damage presence, location, and severity. Damage diagnosis is performed by utilizing measurements that are obtained from a structure being monitored. However, time-varying environmental and operational conditions such as temperature and external loading may produce an adverse effect on damage detection within the structure exposed to these changes. Therefore, in order to achieve successful structural health monitoring goals, it is necessary to develop data normalization techniques which distinguish the effects of damage from those caused by environmental and operational variations. In this study, nonlinear principal component analysis based on unsupervised support vector machine is introduced and incorporated with a discrete-time prediction model and a hypothesis test for data normalization. The proposed nonlinear principal component analysis characterizes the nonlinear relationship between extracted damage-sensitive features and unmeasured environmental and operational parameters by employing kernel functions and by solving a simple eigenvalue problem. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of another nonlinear principal component analysis realized by auto-associative neural network. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is a promising data normalization tool that is capable of detecting damage in the presence of environmental and operational variations.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is concerned with identifying damage based on measurements obtained from structures being monitored. For the civil structures exposed to time-varying environmental and operational conditions, it is inevitable that environmental and operational variability produces an adverse effect on the dynamic behaviors of the structures. Since the signals are measured under the influence of these varying conditions, normalizing the data to distinguish the effects of damage from those caused by the environmental and operational variations is important in order to achieve successful structural health monitoring goals. In this paper, kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) using unsupervised support vector machine is developed and incorporated with a time prediction model for data normalization by characterizing the relationship between the extracted features and an unmeasured environmental parameter. This method performs a nonlinear principal component analysis by using kernel functions in high-dimensional feature spaces without involving computationally expensive nonlinear optimization. The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated using a numerical example with comparison results obtained by applying an autoassociative neural network.},

  abstract = {One structural health monitoring (SHM) method used to detect the occurrence of structural damage is the tracking of a structure’s natural frequencies. However, for bridges this is complicated by the changing environmental and operational conditions which also have an effect on the natural frequencies. Consequently, much of the research effort has been on trying to develop data modelling approaches that correct for, or removes, environmental effects so that changes in structural behaviour can be revealed. However, the fact that the process of extracting frequencies from bridge response data sets has in itself some inherent uncertainties has been largely ignored, forms the major interest of this study. In this paper, various methods for extracting frequency data from time domain signals are reviewed, and their suitability for use in automated approaches discussed. A selection of these methods were then used to obtain frequencies from a continuous acceleration data from a bridge over a 20-day period. Comparisons were then made between the obtained frequencies and any observed differences highlighted between the methods.},

Identification of this need has led to the development of a new measurement system the main element of which is a network of inclinometers. Cubic spline curves which enhance the accuracy of the results are used in the calculation of deflection lines. The designed system may be applied not only in monitoring of bridges during static load testing (short monitoring time: from a few to a dozen hours) but also in long term monitoring during bridge service.

This is the fundamental problem behind the use of inclinometers to measure the deformation of structures. A solid theoretical background, with derivations, is provided for the solution of a real and practical measurement problem. The reconstruction problem is solved using matrix algebraic techniques applied to variational calculus. Tikhonov, spectral, and a new regularization technique based on truncated constrained basis functions are implemented. It is proved that the solution of differential equations via basis functions corresponds to computing the spectra of the bending modes with respect to the basis functions used. This insight yields a method of determining the optimal set of basis functions based on spectral compactness. A completely new approach to computing a linear differential operator which yields a global estimator is presented. The method is also extended to yield a regularizing linear differential operator. The methods are verified, and the claims made substantiated by extensive numerical simulations including Monte Carlo simulations to verify the susceptibility of the solution to noise. The methods are also applied to a real measurement problem of determining the subsidence of rail track during construction in the vicinity of the track.

  abstract = {Bridge management is a complex engineering issue with public safety and financial implications. It is a challenge to provide efficient bridge management systems, taking into account uncertainties in the structural degradation process, the loads and resistance of the structure, the decisions that are made concerning assessment strategies—such as inspections or structural health monitoring (SHM)—and maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. It is important to determine optimal management strategies that satisfy budget constraints, because efficient use of available financial funds is a primary objective of stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a probabilistic framework based on SHM results for optimization of management strategies under multiple criteria, including budget availability. To take into account uncertainties in the decision process, an event tree–based approach is used. This enables quantification of the expected inspection, SHM, maintenance and failure costs, and accuracy of the decision process according to the occurrence and duration of future SHM programs. To include budget constraints, the probability distribution of management cost—defined as the sum of inspection, SHM, and maintenance costs—is determined at each decision time and compared with an ideal budget distribution. The proposed approach is applied to an existing bridge.},

Knowledge of these loads aides in the development of appropriate maintenance plans and enforcement of weight limits on bridges. Bridge weigh in motion (BWIM) technology uses bridges as a scale to measure truck weights and speeds. The research reported in this article pertains to the development of a new BWIM system based on the monitoring of girder rotations at the bridge abutments. The measured end rotations are directly related to the axle loads by means of influence lines. The changes in girder rotations at the abutments are measured by a fibre optic rotation sensor, specifically designed for the proposed BWIM system. The rotation sensors are then incorporated into the BWIM system for correlation of the axle weights to the end span rotations. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed system was examined by tests on a four-span steel girder bridge. The field implementation included calibration and validation of the system with trucks pre-weighed at a nearby weigh station.},

  abstract = {Today, 40\% of the US's freight tonnage is carried by railroads and the demand for railroads is expected to double in 20 years. While use of railroads keeps increasing, operations of maintenance, repair and replacement (MRR) cannot respond to the aging infrastructure immediately due to limited resources. Since railroad bridges are under constant stress of train loads, the assessment of existing railroad bridges is required for sustainable, safe, reliable and continuous railroad operations. However, accurate measurement of bridge movements during operation is a challenging task. This paper proposes a new method fusing multi-metric measurement data obtained from accelerometers and inclinometers in real-Time to provide quantitative information for data-driven structural health assessments. To study the performance of the proposed method, a cantilever beam representing pier bent is simulated in real-Time. Measured responses at the tip of the beam are compared to the displacements estimated by the data fusion method. The results indicate that bridge responses can be accurately estimated even in the events where pseudo-static displacements due to nonsymmetrical heavy train loading are dominant.},

In this paper, evaluation of changes in the flexibility matrix of a structure is presented as a candidate method not only for identifying the presence of the damage but also locating the damage. It is shown that the flexibility matrix can be easily and accurately estimated from a few of the lower frequency modes of vibration of the structure, which can be easily measured. First, with simple analytical beam models, the effect of presence of damage in a structure on its flexibility is studied. By using these analytical models, the effectiveness of using changes in the flexibility matrix in detecting and locating damages is demonstrated.

Three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of a target structure acquired using TLS can have maximum errors of about 10 mm, which is insufficient for the purpose of health monitoring of structures. A displacement measurement model is presented to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The model is tested experimentally on a simply supported steel beam. Measurements were made using three different techniques: (1) linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs), (2) electric strain gages, and (3) a long gage fiber optic sensor. The maximum deflections estimated by the TLS model are less than 1 mm and within 1.6\% of those measured directly by LVDT. Although GPS methods allow measurement of displacements only at the GPS receiver antenna location, the proposed TLS method allows measurement of the entire building's or bridge's deformed shape, and thus a realistic solution for monitoring structures at both structure and member level. Furthermore, it can be used to create a 3D finite element model of a structural member or the entire structure at any instance of time automatically. Through periodic measurements of deformations of a structure or a structural member and performing inverse structural analyses with the measured 3D displacements, the health of the structure can be monitored continuously. © 2007 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.},

  abstract = {When using the analysis of vibration measurements as a tool for health monitoring of bridges, the problem arises of separating abnormal changes from normal changes in the dynamic behaviour. Normal changes are caused by varying environmental conditions such as humidity, wind and most important, temperature. The temperature may have an impact on the boundary conditions and the material properties. Abnormal changes on the other hand are caused by a loss of stiffness somewhere along the bridge. It is clear that the normal changes should not raise an alarm in the monitoring system (i.e. a false positive), whereas the abnormal changes may be critical for the structure's safety. In the frame of the European SIMCES-project, the Z24-Bridge in Switzerland was monitored during almost one year before it was artificially damaged. Black-box models are determined from the healthy-bridge data. These models describe the variations of eigenfrequencies as a function of temperature. New data are compared with the models. If an eigenfrequency exceeds certain confidence intervals of the model, there is probably another cause than the temperature that drives the eigenfrequency variations, for instance damage.

Several investigations demonstrated that supplementing the assessment with monitoring data enables to achieve more reliable remaining fatigue life estimations. In this paper, an event-driven monitoring system based on a wireless sensor network that consists of two functionally different components was designed and tested. Sentinel nodes, which were mounted on the track, were used for detecting approaching trains and alerting with alarm messages the monitoring nodes. These nodes, which were mounted on the bridge, started strain sensing and data recording after receiving the alarm message and went back to a power saving mode upon completion. An embedded data processing algorithm transformed the recorded raw data into a much smaller data set representing strain cycles. A test deployment on a railway bridge demonstrated that train detection and alarming was fast and reliable. The combination of event-driven monitoring and embedded data processing allowed to extend the battery lifetime of monitoring nodes to several months. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Civil engineering structures are difficult to model accurately and this challenge is compounded when structures are built in uncertain environments. As consequence, their real behavior is hard to predict; such difficulties have important effects on the reliability of damage detection. Such situations encourage the enhancement of traditional approximate structural assessments through in-service measurements and interpretation of monitoring data. While some proposals have recently been made, in general, no current methodology for detection of anomalous behavior from measurement data can be reliably applied to complex structures in practical situations. This paper presents two new methodologies for model-free data interpretation to identify and localize anomalous behavior in civil engineering structures. Two statistical methods (i) moving principal component analysis and (ii) moving correlation analysis have been demonstrated to be useful for damage detection during continuous static monitoring of civil structures. The algorithms are designed to learn characteristics of time series generated by sensor data during a period called the initialization phase where the structure is assumed to behave normally. This phase subsequently helps identify those behaviors which can be classified as anomalous. In this way the new methodologies can effectively identify anomalous behaviors without explicit (and costly) knowledge of structural characteristics such as geometry and models of behavior. The methodologies have been tested on numerically simulated elements with sensors at a range of damage severities. A comparative study with wavelet and other statistical analyses demonstrates superior performance for identifying the presence of damage.},

  abstract = {Detection of cracks on bridge decks is a vital task for maintaining the structural health and reliability of concrete bridges. Robotic imaging can be used to obtain bridge surface image sets for automated on-site analysis. We present a novel automated crack detection algorithm, the STRUM (spatially tuned robust multifeature) classifier, and demonstrate results on real bridge data using a state-of-the-art robotic bridge scanning system. By using machine learning classification, we eliminate the need for manually tuning threshold parameters. The algorithm uses robust curve fitting to spatially localize potential crack regions even in the presence of noise. Multiple visual features that are spatially tuned to these regions are computed. Feature computation includes examining the scale-space of the local feature in order to represent the information and the unknown salient scale of the crack. The classification results are obtained with real bridge data from hundreds of crack regions over two bridges. This comprehensive analysis shows a peak STRUM classifier performance of 95\% compared with 69\% accuracy from a more typical image-based approach. In order to create a composite global view of a large bridge span, an image sequence from the robot is aligned computationally to create a continuous mosaic. A crack density map for the bridge mosaic provides a computational description as well as a global view of the spatial patterns of bridge deck cracking.

  abstract = {Bridge scour is the number one cause of failure in bridges located over waterways. Scour leads to rapid losses in foundation stiffness and can cause sudden collapse. Previous research on bridge health monitoring has used changes in natural frequency to identify damage in bridge beams. The possibility of using a similar approach to identifying scour is investigated in this paper. To assess if this approach is feasible, it is necessary to establish how scour affects the natural frequency of a bridge, and if it is possible to measure changes in frequency using the bridge dynamic response to a passing vehicle. To address these questions, a novel vehicle–bridge–soil interaction (VBSI) model was developed. By carrying out a modal study in this model, it is shown that for a wide range of possible soil states, there is a clear reduction in the natural frequency of the first mode of the bridge with scour. Moreover, it is shown that the response signals on the bridge from vehicular loading are sufficient to allow these changes in frequency to be detected.

  abstract = {Scour around bridge foundations is one of the leading causes of bridge failure. Up until recently, the monitoring of this phenomenon was primarily based around using underwater instrumentation to monitor the progression of scour holes as they develop around foundation systems. Vibration-based damage detection techniques have been used to detect damage in bridge beams. The application of these vibration based methods to the detection of scour has come to the fore in research in recent years. This paper examines the effect that scour has on the frequency response of a driven pile foundation system, similar to those used to support road and rail bridges. The effect of scour on the vibration characteristics of the pile is examined using laboratory and field testing. It is clear that there is a very clear reduction in the natural frequency of the pile as the severity of scour increases. It is shown that by combining state-of-the-art geotechnical techniques with relatively simple finite element modelling approaches, it is possible to accurately predict the natural frequency of the pile for a given scour depth. Therefore, the paper proposes a method that would allow the estimation of scour depth for a given observed pile frequency.},

  abstract = {Bridge structural health monitoring involves the collection and analysis of systematic measurements obtained from installed sensors on the bridge. While there are many quality certification systems available for civil engineering systems, e.g. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), typical bridge monitoring specifications do not explicitly address performance requirements. As the applications of bridge structural health monitoring becomes more varied and advanced it will become necessary to ascertain the quality of measured data in order to check its suitability for new and varied applications. The quality of measured data has a direct impact on the results obtained from data analysis in structural health monitoring. The quality of measured data for a bridge monitoring system should meet three basic criteria: First, measured data should be devoid of anomalies such as signal clipping, intermittent noise spikes, temporary signal dropouts, and spurious trends. Second, the errors, including aliasing and quantization, and system noise should be within an acceptable range. Lastly, the measured data should satisfy required assumptions, such as stationarity and normality. Data qualification is defined as validating the quality of measured data and quantifying errors and noise to ensure the measured data sufficiently satisfies the above mentioned criteria. Despite the tremendous impact the quality of measured data has on bridge structural health monitoring, data qualification has not been formalized for bridge monitoring to provide a basis for bridge monitoring data specifications. This paper proposes measures of data qualification that can be used as a foundation for data specifications in bridge structural health monitoring. This paper will use data collected from monitored bridges in the Connecticut Long Term Bridge Monitoring program as examples of issues faced when using long term bridge monitoring data acquisition systems. © ASCE 2011.},

A more efficient monitoring method, using a type of wireless communication called LPWA (low-power wide area) network technology, has also recently become available. In the present study, a monitoring system was developed that combines tilt sensors and LPWA network technology for measuring the movement of slopes and sending the information through wireless communication. First, radio wave propagation experiments were conducted to find the proper location for the gateway device of the monitoring system. Then, in March 2018, the developed system that consists of tilt and water-level sensors and the wireless communication of LPWA was installed at an observation site. Since the installation, the data from the tilt sensors have been successfully collected through LPWA, and a slope failure was unexpectedly observed at the observation site during the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018, which caused severe disasters, particularly from western Japan to the Tokai region. Using the data from the tilt sensors, the rainfall data, and the groundwater level, the slope failure was analysed. A site investigation was conducted, and the shear strength parameter was examined using back analysis method. In conclusion, the developed system using sensors and LPWA has continued to efficiently monitor the movement of the targeted slope, but the collection of additional data will be required to increase the reliability of the system. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technology is considered to be a key technology to reduce the maintenance cost and meanwhile ensure the operational safety of aircraft structures. It has gradually developed from theoretic and fundamental research to real-world engineering applications in recent decades. The problem of reliable damage monitoring under time-varying conditions is a main issue for the aerospace engineering applications of SHM technology. Among the existing SHM methods, Guided Wave (GW) and piezoelectric sensor-based SHM technique is a promising method due to its high damage sensitivity and long monitoring range. Nevertheless the reliability problem should be addressed. Several methods including environmental parameter compensation, baseline signal dependency reduction and data normalization, have been well studied but limitations remain. This paper proposes a damage propagation monitoring method based on an improved Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It can be used on-line without any structural mechanical model and a priori knowledge of damage and time-varying conditions. With this method, a baselineGMMis constructed first based on the GW features obtained under time-varying conditions when the structure under monitoring is in the healthy state. When a new GW feature is obtained during the on-line damage monitoring process, the GMM can be updated by an adaptive migration mechanism including dynamic learning and Gaussian components split-merge. The mixture probability distribution structure of the GMM and the number of Gaussian components can be optimized adaptively. Then an on-lineGMMcan be obtained. Finally, a best match based Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is studied to measure the migration degree between the baseline GMM and the on-line GMM to reveal the weak cumulative changes of the damage propagation mixed in the time-varying influence. A wing spar of an aircraft is used to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the crack propagation under changing structural boundary conditions can be monitored reliably. The method is not limited by the properties of the structure, and thus it is feasible to be applied to composite structure. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The method of surrogates is widely used in the field of nonlinear data analysis for testing for weak nonlinearities. The two most commonly used algorithms for generating surrogates are the amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (AAFT) and the iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transfom (IAAFT) algorithm. Both the AAFT and IAAFT algorithm conserve the amplitude distribution in real space and reproduce the power spectrum (PS) of the original data set very accurately. The basic assumption in both algorithms is that higher-order correlations can be wiped out using a Fourier phase randomization procedure. In both cases, however, the randomness of the Fourier phases is only imposed before the (first) Fourier back tranformation. Until now, it has not been studied how the subsequent remapping and iteration steps may affect the randomness of the phases. Using the Lorenz system as an example, we show that both algorithms may create surrogate realizations containing Fourier phase correlations. We present two new iterative surrogate data generating methods being able to control the randomization of Fourier phases at every iteration step. The resulting surrogate realizations which are truly linear by construction display all properties needed for surrogate data.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric two sample or homogeneity testing is a decision theoretic problem that involves identifying differences between two random variables without making parametric assumptions about their underlying distributions. The literature is old and rich, with a wide variety of statistics having being intelligently designed and analyzed, both for the unidimensional and the multivariate setting. Our contribution is to tie together many of these tests, drawing connections between seemingly very different statistics. In this work, our central object is the Wasserstein distance, as we form a chain of connections from univariate methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, PP/QQ plots and ROC/ODC curves, to multivariate tests involving energy statistics and kernel based maximum mean discrepancy. Some connections proceed through the construction of a smoothed Wasserstein distance, and others through the pursuit of a “distribution-free” Wasserstein test. Some observations in this chain are implicit in the literature, while others seem to have not been noticed thus far. Given nonparametric two sample testing’s classical and continued importance, we aim to provide useful connections for theorists and practitioners familiar with one subset of methods but not others.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Due to the increasing quest of adopting low-cost sensors in structural health monitoring~(SHM) processes, which may lead to detecting signals contaminated by significant levels of noise, the need to devise appropriate and effective denoising strategies, at the post-processing stage, is becoming more and more essential. Among several approaches proposed in the literature, it has been demonstrated that the employment of discrete wavelet transform~(DWT) as a multi-rate filter bank, as well as the use of singular value decomposition~(SVD), may result to be quite effective in signal denoising within various research fields, as biological, acoustic and mechanical. Here, DWT- and SVD-based denoising techniques are first independently reconsidered and reimplemented, aiming at exploring their optimal calibration in purifying noise-corrupted vibration response signals encountered in civil engineering applications. Then, a systematic performance evaluation is provided within a comparative framework, developed at an increasing level of noise affecting the measurements, in terms of noise-to-signal~(               N               /               S               ) ratio. In the study, two specific classes of synthetic response signals are first considered, namely earthquake and ambient vibration signals, since they may be assumed as representative of more general non-stationary and stationary signal typologies, respectively. To achieve a complete description of the clarified signal, strengths and weaknesses of the two denoising approaches are explored, in both time and frequency domains. The results prove the effectiveness of the analyzed implementations, especially in purifying seismic response signals, while some limitations may arise concerning the treatment of ambient vibration signals, in particular for the DWT-based denoising technique. Finally, a real case study is analyzed, where both denoising approaches are adapted and employed for clarifying acceleration signals detected on a modern short-span railway bridge, with rather satisfactory results, for both techniques.},

These large-scale composite structures are fundamentally enclosed acoustic cavities and currently have limited, if any, structural health monitoring (SHM) in place. A novel acoustics-based structural sensing and health monitoring technique is developed, requiring efficient algorithms for operational damage detection of cavity structures. This paper describes the selection of a set of statistical features for acoustics-based damage detection of enclosed cavities, such as wind turbine blades, as well as a systematic approach used in the identification of competent machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods are identified and used with optimal feature selection for decision-making via binary classification algorithms. A laboratory-scale wind turbine with hollow composite blades was built for damage detection studies. This test rig allows for testing of stationary or rotating blades, of which time and frequency domain information can be collected to establish baseline characteristics. The test rig can then be used to observe any deviations from the baseline characteristics. An external microphone attached to the tower will be utilized to monitor blade health while blades are internally ensonified by wireless speakers. An initial test campaign with healthy and damaged blade specimens is carried out to arrive at several conclusions on the detectability and feature extraction capabilities required for damage detection. © 2017 by ASME.},

  abstract = {A hypothesis testing framework is introduced for bridge damage detection, which enables a rigorous, decision-oriented approach for detection of bridge damage when it exists. A bridge damage detection hypothesis test is developed using girder distribution factors (GDF) under operational, output-only strain monitoring. GDFs are calculated from measured strain data collected during traffic events at the Powder Mill Bridge in Barre, Massachusetts. A sample of GDFs is drawn to establish a baseline over the course of one week, representing the probabilistic behavior of a healthy bridge under normal operating conditions. A new sample can be compared with the baseline at the end of each day, providing a timely and effective operational damage detection method. A calibrated finite element model is used to simulate damaged bridge GDF samples under four damage scenarios. The damaged bridge GDF samples are compared with the healthy baseline sample using the rank-sum test, and the results are employed to develop a damage index capable of alerting bridge owners of potential damage. A simple bootstrap resampling scheme is used to evaluate the probability of issuing a false alarm (Type I error), as well as the likelihood of not issuing an alert when the bridge is damaged (Type II error). A three-dimensional statistical bridge signature is developed to aid damage localization and assessment. Nonparametric prediction intervals corresponding to a baseline signature are generated using the bootstrap method, creating an envelope of possible baseline bridge signatures. When a bridge signature falls outside the baseline bridge signature envelope, damage is detected. Damage was successfully identified for all four artificial damage cases considered. The overall damage detection method is designed to alert bridge owners when damage is detected and to provide a probabilistic tool to aid damage assessment and localization while controlling for both Type I and Type II errors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The system, consisting of a high speed video camera, an optical lens, lighting lamps and a precision target, can perform measurements with acquisition frame rates ranging from 64. fps to 500. fps, and be articulated with other measurement systems, which promotes its integration in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Preliminary tests of the system have shown that the measurements' precision can be affected by: (i) movements of the camera stand and, therefore, rigid supports should be used and the camera should be protected from air flows; (ii) the distortion of the field of view, caused by the flow of heat waves generated by IR incandescent lighting and, therefore, the operating time of the lamps should be limited. The system was used to measure the displacement of a railway bridge's deck, induced by the passage of trains at speeds between 120. km/h and 180. km/h, yielding a very good agreement between the results of displacement measurement obtained with the video system and with a LVDT. The achieved precision was below 0.1. mm for distances from the camera to the target up to 15. m, and in the order of 0.25. mm for a distance of 25. m. The application of an image processing technique at subpixel level resulted in real precisions generally inferior to the theoretical precisions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Measurements of deflections, rotations, and strain provide indications of damages as well as changes in the values of parameters such as Young's modulus. Finite-element model-updating methods have been developed in the 1990s for identifying structural state from measurements. Currently most methods aim to determine the values of stiffness coefficients that result in measured responses. In the present work, a model calibration method identifies causes of structural behavior such as support conditions and material properties. Static measurement data are employed for model calibration. A case study of the Lutrive Bridge in Switzerland illustrates the methodology. Candidate models whose responses reasonably match measured data are identified. These models are then examined to determine whether the calibrated values are physically possible. Such examinations lead to either model rejection or further measurements.},

However, further development of this technology is needed to achieve its efficient and widespread use in the structural health monitoring of bridges. The development of new and efficient transducers is mandatory to expand this novel technology to the field of civil engineering. This work is focused on the development and application to concrete bridges of new and reliable optical based transducers, more specifically, a vertical displacement transducer and a strain transducer to be embedded into concrete, both based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing technology. The conception and the development of these innovative transducers, aiming at their integration in the structural health monitoring of concrete bridges, are referred to. A field application of the developed transducers is presented invoking the advanced optical based structural monitoring system of the Lezíria Bridge.

Finally, the operation mode and the performance of the optical based structural monitoring system used for the permanent surveillance of the Lezíria Bridge are described and appraised. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the lack of availability of data from a full range of changing operational and damage conditions, with which to train an identification/classification algorithm. This paper presents a framework based on Bayesian non-parametric clustering, in particular Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture models, for performing SHM tasks in a semi-supervised manner, including an online feature extraction method. Previously, methods applied for SHM of structures in operation, such as bridges, have required at least a year's worth of data before any inferences on performance or structural condition can be made. The method introduced here avoids the need for training data to be collected before inference can begin and increases in robustness as more data are added online. The method is demonstrated on two datasets; one from a laboratory test, the other from a full scale test on civil infrastructure. Results show very good classification accuracy and the ability to incorporate information online (e.g. regarding environmental changes). © 2018 The Authors},

RT-link provides predictable lifetime for battery-operated embedded nodes, bounded end-to-end delay across multiple hops, and collision-free operation. We investigate the use of hardware-based time-synchronization for infrastructure nodes by using an AM carrier-current radio for indoors and atomic clock receivers for outdoors. Mobile nodes are synchronized via in-band software synchronization within the same framework. We identify three key observations in the design and deployment of RT-link: (a) hardware-based global-time synchronization is a robust and scalable option to in-band software-based techniques, (b) achieving global time-synchronization is both economical and convenient for indoor and outdoor deployments, (c) RT-link achieves a practical lifetime of over 2 years. Through analysis and simulation, we show that RT-link outperforms energy-efficient link protocols such as B-MAC in terms of node lifetime and end-to-end latency. The protocol supports flexible services such as on-demand end-to-end rate control and logical topology control. We implemented RT-link on the CMU FireFly sensor platform and have integrated it within the nano-RK real-time sensor OS.

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Numerous methods have been developed in the context of expert and intelligent systems for structural health monitoring (SHM) with wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, these techniques have been proven to be efficient when dealing with continuous signals, and the applicability of such expert systems with discrete noisy signals has not yet been explored. This study presents an intelligent data mining methodology as part of an expert system developed for SHM with noisy and delayed signals, which are generated by a through-substrate self-powered sensor network. The noted sensor network has been demonstrated as an effective means for minimizing energy consumption in WSNs for SHM. Experimental vibration tests were conducted on a cantilever plate to evaluate the developed expert system for SHM. The proposed data mining method is based on the integration of pattern recognition, an innovative probabilistic approach, and machine learning. The novelty of the proposed system for SHM with data interpretation methodology lies in the integration of the noted intelligent techniques on discrete, binary, noisy, and delayed patterns of signals collected from self-powered sensing technology in the application to a practical engineering problem, i.e., data-driven energy-efficient SHM. Results confirm that the proposed data mining method employing a probabilistic approach can be effectively used to reconstruct delayed and missing signals, thereby addressing the important issue of energy availability for intelligent SHM systems being used for damage identification in civil and aerospace structures. The applicability and effectiveness of the expert system with the data mining approach in detecting damage with noisy signals was demonstrated for plate-like structures with an accuracy of 97\%. The present study successfully contributes to advance data mining and signal processing techniques in the SHM domain, indicating a practical application of expert and intelligent systems applied to damage detection in SHM platforms. Findings from this research pave a way for development of the data analysis techniques that can be employed for interpreting noisy and incomplete signals collected from various expert systems such as those being used in intelligent infrastructure monitoring systems and smart cities.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

This article contributes to the development of an alternative monitoring system for civil structures, based on passive measurements of seismic elastic waves. Cross-correlations of traffic noise recorded at geophone receiver pairs were found to be sufficiently stable for comparison and sensitive to velocity changes in the medium. As such velocity variations could be caused by damage, their detection would be valuable in structural health monitoring systems. A method, originally introduced for seismological applications and named Passive Image Interferometry, was used to quantify small velocity fluctuations in the medium and thereby observe structural changes. Evaluation of more than 2 months of continuous geophone recordings at a reinforced concrete bridge yielded velocity variations Δv/v in the range of -1.5\% to +2.1\%. The observed fluctuations correlate with associated temperature time series with a striking resemblance which is remarkable for two completely independent data sets. Using a linear regression approach, a relationship between temperature and velocity variations of on average 0.064\% °C -1 can be identified. This value corresponds well to other studies on concrete structures. © 2015 Acoustical Society of America.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using nondestructive test data has become promising for finite element (FE) model updating, model verification, structural evaluation and damage assessment. This research presents a multiresponse structural parameter estimation method for the automated FE model updating using data obtained from a set of nondestructive tests conducted on a laboratory bridge model. Both stiffness and mass parameters are updated at the element level, simultaneously. Having measurement and modeling errors is an inevitable part of data acquisition systems and finite element models. The presence of these errors can affect the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Therefore, an error sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was used to study the input–output error behavior of each parameter based on the load cases and measurement locations of the nondestructive tests. Given the measured experimental responses, the goal was to select the unknown parameters of the FE model with high observability that leads to creating a well-conditioned system with the least sensitivity to measurement errors. A data quality study was performed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the measured data. Based on this study, a subset of the most reliable measured data was selected for the FE model updating. The selected subset of higher quality measurements and the observable unknown parameters were used for FE model updating. Three static and dynamic error functions were used for structural parameter estimation using the selected measured static strains, displacements, and slopes as well as dynamic natural frequencies and associated mode shapes. The measured data sets were used separately and also together for multiresponse FE model updating to match the predicted analytical response with the measured data. The FE model was successfully calibrated using multiresponse data. Two separate commercially available software packages were used with real-time data communications utilizing Application Program Interface (API) scripts. This approach was efficient in utilizing these software packages for automated and systematic FE model updating. The usefulness of the proposed method for automated finite element model updating at the element level is shown by being able to lead to simultaneous estimation of the stiffness and mass parameters using experimental data.},

However, providing constant measurement updates incurs high communication costs for each individual node, resulting in increased energy depletion in the network. Data reduction strategies aim at reducing the amount of data sent by each node, for example by predicting the measured values both at the source and the sink node, thus only requiring nodes to send the readings that deviate from the prediction. While effectively reducing power consumption, such techniques so far needed to rely on a-priori knowledge to correctly model the expected values. Our approach instead employs an algorithm that requires no prior modeling, allowing nodes to work independently and without using global model parameters. Using the LeastMean-Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm on a publicly available, real-world (office environment) temperature data set, we have been able to achieve up to 92\% communication reduction while maintaining a minimal accuracy of 0.5 degree Celsius.},

This technology is a novel passive sensing system which focuses on the reference signals embedded in the sub-frames of LTE resource grid. It compares the received signal with the expected reference signal, extracts the evaluated channel state information (CSI) and analyses it to estimate the change in the environment. For vehicle detection and subsequent classification, authors’ setup is similar to a passive radar in forward scattering radar (FSR) mode. Instead of performing the radio frequency (RF) signals directly, the authors take advantage of the processing that happens in a LTE receiver user equipment (UE). The authors tap into the channel estimation and equalisation block and extract the CSI value. CSI value reflects the property of the communication channel between communication base station (eNodeB) and UE. The authors use CSI values for with vehicle and without vehicle case in outdoor open road environment. Being a receiver-only system, there is no need for any transmission and related regulations. Therefore, this system is low cost, power-efficient and difficult to detect. Also, most of its processing will be done by the existing LTE communication receiver (UE). Here, the authors establish authors’ claim by analysing field-collected data. Live LTE downlink (DL) signal is captured using modelled LTE UE using software defined radio (SDR). The detection analysis and classification performance show promising results and ascertain that LTE-CommSense is capable of detection and classification of different types of vehicles in outdoor road environment.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Anomaly detection by Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) is a popular unsupervised learning approach to structural health monitoring (SHM). Despite the popularity and high applicability of the MSD-based anomaly detection method, some major challenging issues and limitations such as environmental variability, determination of an inappropriate threshold limit, estimation of an inaccurate covariance matrix, and non-Gaussianity of training data may lead to false alarms and erroneous results of damage detection. The main objective of this article is to propose a novel anomaly detection method based on adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance and one-class kNN rule called AMSD-kNN for SHM under varying environmental conditions. The central idea behind the proposed method is to find sufficient nearest neighbors of training and testing datasets in a two-stage procedure for removing the environmental variability conditions and estimate local covariance matrices. An effective approach based on a multivariate normality hypothesis test is proposed to find sufficient nearest neighbors that guarantee the estimate of well-conditioned local covariance matrices. The great novelty of the proposed AMSD-kNN method is to create a novel unsupervised learning strategy for SHM by a new multivariate distance measure and one-class kNN rule. Generalized extreme value distribution modeling by the block maxima (BM) method is presented to determine an accurate threshold limit. Due to the importance of choosing adequate blocks in the BM method, a goodness-of-fit measure via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test is applied to select an optimal block number. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by two well-known benchmark structures. Several comparative studies are also conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that the proposed AMSD-kNN and BM methods highly succeed in detecting damage under environmental variability conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The study is applied to a piezoelectric Lamb wave sensor network and is validated experimentally on a simple aluminium skin. The analytically-derived dispersion curves for Lamb wave propagation in aluminium are used in order to determine the wave velocities and thus their arrival time at given sensors. The Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) is used to simulate the entire waveform propagation. Once the agreement between analytical, numerical and experimental data is verified on a baseline undamaged condition, the parametric LISA model has been iteratively run, varying the position and the length of a crack on an aluminium skin panel, generating the virtual experience necessary to train a supervised learning regressor based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). After the algorithm structure has been statistically optimised, the network sensitivity to input variations has been evaluated on simulated signals through a technique inspired by information gap theory. Real Lamb wave signals are then processed into the algorithm, providing feasible real-time indication of damage characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an innovative nonlinear model of a self-sensing soft actuator and a switching extended Kalman filter, which is used as an observer for health monitoring such as a virtual sensor. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and measurements justify the observation strategy. An adaptive position control structure based on the discrete wavelet packets transform method is proposed. Stimulus-responsive polymers are relevant for the realization of smart systems (capable of both sensing and actuating) in the context of soft actuators, for example, in bioinspired robotics, orthotic, and prosthetic technology. A real-time implementation of health monitoring techniques is important to guarantee a gentle, fault-free operation of the soft actuator in the presence of loads. The presented case shows a microrobotic application and measured results show the effectiveness of the developed observer regarding the soft actuator temperature to guarantee its longevity. The latter is necessary for normal operation without a test bench, because the states cannot be measured, but they need to be known for the implementation of the proposed health monitoring algorithms. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

It uses the widely-available GSM/GPRS network to send monitoring data and alerts to a number of users via FTP, SMS, and e-mail. Its rugged construction, completely wireless design, and extensive powersaving measures allow for a field life of 3-4 years powered only by alkaline batteries. Specifically, this paper presents a major enhancement to the Smart Brick: the addition of short-range wireless communication capability. This addition will allow several SmartBrick devices to coordinate data collection and aggregate data before uploading recorded measurements.

  abstract = {To implement steel bridge maintenance, especially that related to fatigue damage, it is important to monitor bridge deformations under traffic conditions. Bridges deform and rotate differently under traffic load conditions because their structures differ in terms of length and flexibility. Such monitoring enables the identification of the cause of stress concentrations that cause fatigue damage and the proposal of appropriate countermeasures. However, although bridge deformation monitoring requires observations of bridge angle response as well as the bridge displacement response, measuring the rotation angle response of a bridge subject to traffic loads is difficult. Theoretically, the rotation angle response can be calculated by integrating the angular velocity, but for field measurements of actual in-service bridges, estimating the necessary boundary conditions would be difficult due to traffic-induced vibration. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method for determining the rotation angle response of an in-service bridge from its angular velocity, as measured by a inertial measurement unit (IMU). To verify our proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) IMUs and two contact displacement gauges. The results showed that our proposed method provided high accuracy when compared to the reference responses calculated by the contact displacement gauges.},

Therefore, an increase in the maintenance and management costs of the treadle damage is concerned. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to classify vehicles using non-contact treadle sensors for improving durability from physical impacts. This was based on the KHC's classification criteria and showed a classification accuracy of 99.5 \% in one experiment with 1892 vehicles through Changwon tollgate in 1020 local road.

Our findings are that a large number of studies considered damage detection by data processing methods, whereas a relatively small number of studies were devoted to the estimation of structural capacities and the remaining service life of bridges.

While some sensors such as temperature, or humidity sensors produce a few bits of data periodically, imaging sensors output data in the range of megabytes every second. This raises a complexity for battery operated smart cameras, as they would be required to perform intensive image processing operations on large volumes of data, within energy consumption constraints. By using intelligence partitioning we analyse the effects of different partitioning scenarios for the processing tasks between the smart camera node, the fog computing layer and cloud computing, in the node energy consumption as well as the real time performance of the WVSN (Wireless Vision Sensor Node). The results obtained show that traditional design space exploration approaches are inefficient for WVSN, while intelligence partitioning enhances the energy consumption performance of the smart camera node and meets the timing constraints.},

Based on shape of the bridge, a spanning tree is employed to build linear topology WSNs and achieve time synchronization in this paper. Two-way time message exchange (TTME) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are employed for clock offset estimation. Multiple TTMEs are proposed to obtain a subset of TTME observations. The time out restriction and retry mechanism are employed to avoid the estimation errors that are caused by continuous clock offset and software latencies. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could avoid the estimation errors caused by clock drift and minimize the estimation error due to the large random variable delay jitter.

  abstract = {Cointegration is now extensively used to model the long term common trends among economic variables in the field of econometrics. Recently, cointegration has been successfully implemented in the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), where it has been used to remove the confounding influences of environmental and operational variations (EOVs) that can often mask the signature of structural damage. However, restrained by its linear nature, the conventional cointegration approach has limited power in modelling systems where measurands are nonlinearly related; this occurs, for example, in the benchmark study of the Z24 Bridge, where nonlinear relationships between natural frequencies were induced during a period of very cold temperatures. To allow the removal of EOVs from SHM data with nonlinear relationships like this, this paper extends the well-established cointegration method to a nonlinear context, which is to allow a breakpoint in the cointegrating vector. In a novel approach, the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) statistic is used to find which position is most appropriate for inserting a breakpoint, the Johansen procedure is then utilised for the estimation of cointegrating vectors. The proposed approach is examined with a simulated case and real SHM data from the Z24 Bridge, demonstrating that the EOVs can be neatly eliminated.},

  abstract = {The structural health monitoring relies on the continuous observation of a dynamic system over time to identify its actual condition, detect abnormal behaviors, and predict future states. The regular changes in environmental factors have been reported as one of the main challenges for the application of structural health monitoring systems. These influences in the structural responses are in general nonlinear, affecting the damage-sensitive features in the most varied forms. The usual process to remove these normal changes is referred to as data normalization. In that regard, principal component analysis is probably the most studied algorithm in structural health monitoring, having numerous versions to learn strong nonlinear normal changes. However, in most cases, not all variability is properly accounted for via the existing nonlinear principal component analysis approaches, resulting in poor damage detection and quantification performances. In this article, a new paradigm based on deep principal component analysis, rooted in the deep learning field, is presented to overcome these limitations. This approach extracts the most salient underlying feature distributions by stacking multiple feedforward neural networks trained to learn an identity mapping of the input variables, where the network inputs are reproduced into the outputs. Similar to the traditional nonlinear principal component analysis–based approach, our approach identifies a nonlinear output-only model of an undamaged structure by comprising modal features into an internal bottleneck layer, which implicitly represents the independent environmental factors. The proposed technique is validated through the application on a progressively damaged prestressed concrete bridge and a three-span suspension bridge. The experimental results demonstrate that capturing the most slight nonlinear variations in the data can lead to improved data normalization and, consequently, better damage detection and quantification performances. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Consequently, characteristics such as WSN adaptability, low-overhead, and low-energy consumption are particularly relevant in dynamic and autonomous sensing environments where the measuring requirements change and human intervention is not viable. To tackle this issue, this article proposes e-LiteSense as an adaptive, energy-aware sensing solution for WSNs, capable of auto-regulate how data are sensed, adjusting it to each applicational scenario. The proposed adaptive scheme is able to maintain the sensing accuracy of the physical phenomena, while reducing the overall process overhead. In this way, the adaptive algorithm relies on low-complexity rules to establish the sensing frequency weighting the recent drifts of the physical parameter and the levels of remaining energy in the sensor. Using datasets from WSN operational scenarios, we prove e-LiteSense effectiveness in self-regulating data sensing accurately through a low-overhead process where the WSN energy levels are preserved. This constitutes a step-forward for implementing self-adaptive energy-aware data sensing in dynamic WSN environments.},

The modelling approach uses Euler–Bernoulli beam elements with small modifications to the local flexibility in the vicinity of cracks. This crack model is then used to estimate the crack locations and sizes, by minimizing the difference between the measured and predicted natural frequencies via model updating. The uniqueness of the approach is that the simplified crack model allows the location and damage extent to be estimated directly. The simplified crack model may also be used to generate training data for pattern recognition approaches to health monitoring. The proposed method has been illustrated using the experimental data on beam examples.},

By separating contributions of the first two factors, one can estimate the natural frequency of a bridge indirectly from vehicle acceleration response when it crosses a bridge. In this paper, we apply this concept to estimate the bridge fundamental frequency indirectly using the response of a passing instrumented vehicle. The paper first describes analytical formulation and finite element simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Afterwards, it describes an experimental verification as a proof-of-concept of the method on a full-scale simply-supported short span bridge by using a light commercial vehicle instrumented with accelerometer. Dynamic responses of the vehicle while passing the bridge are recorded and analyzed. Spectra analysis of the vehicle responses reveal that the first natural frequency of the bridge can be estimated with reasonable accuracy when the vehicle moves with constant velocity. The concept of indirect frequency estimation is useful for assessment of short and medium span bridges where permanent instrumentation and routine visual inspection can be too costly. In this method, one can use inspection vehicle instrumented with vibration sensor to conduct periodic measurements by passing the vehicle over several monitored bridges and estimate their fundamental frequencies. When significant change in frequency is detected, detail inspections can be further conducted to investigate the possible damage on the bridge.},

Generally a progressive destructive test is conducted on a small scale specimen in a controlled environment such as laboratory. On-site full-scale progressive damage of an existing structure, which is rare considering cost and size of the structure, is an important learning opportunity in a framework of structural health monitoring research. Such a test provides an opportunity to observe the real change in structural characteristics which often masked by environment effects. Moreover such a test can be utilized as a benchmark for several damage detection methods. In this paper a full-scale progressive destructive test of an overpass post-tensioned bridge is presented. The bridge was instrumented with vibration sensors and the ambient acceleration responses were recorded during damage stages. Damage was introduced by cutting one of bridge piers at the footing level. This type of damage is expected to simulate a condition where a bridge suffers from a non-uniform pier settlement. By applying time and frequency domain vibration analysis, as well as system identification, evolution of dynamic characteristics caused by the damage is quantified. The results show that changes of natural frequencies are clearly visible, thus can be used as indicator of damage presence, while the change in mode shapes can be used as the local damage indicator.},

Overcoming these drawbacks, in this study the information inherent in the SHM system and the known relationships between the sensors are used for fault detection without the need for additional sensors ("analytical redundancy"). Furthermore, the analytical redundancy approach is implemented in a fully decentralized manner: Partial models of the SHM system, being embedded directly into the wireless sensor nodes, enable each sensor node to autonomously detect sensor faults in real time while efficiently using the limited computing resources.

In reality, structures are subject to changing environmental and operational conditions that affect measured signals, and these ambient variations of the system can often mask subtle changes in the system's vibration signal caused by damage. Data normalization is a procedure to normalize datasets, so that signal changes caused by operational and environmental variations of the system can be separated from structural changes of interest, such as structural deterioration or degradation.

  abstract = {Damage detection techniques have been proposed to exploit changes in modal parameters and to identify the extent and location of damage in large structures. Most of such techniques, however, generally neglect the environmental effects on modal parameters. Such environmental effects include changes in loads, boundary conditions, temperature, and humidity. In fact, the changes due to environmental effects can often mask more subtle structural changes caused by damage. This paper examines a linear adaptive model to discriminate the changes of modal parameters due to temperature changes from those caused by structural damage or other environmental effects. Data from the Alamosa Canyon Bridge in the state of New Mexico were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive filter for this problem. Results indicate that a linear four-input (two time and two spatial dimensions) filter to temperature can reproduce the natural variability of the frequencies with respect to time of day. Using this simple model, we attempt to establish a confidence interval of the frequencies for a new temperature profile in order to discriminate the natural variation due to temperature.

  abstract = {Health monitoring of reinforced concrete bridges and other large-scale civil infrastructures has received considerable attention in recent years. However, traditional inspection methods (x-ray, C-scan, etc) are expensive and sometimes ineffective for large-scale structures. Piezoceramic transducers have emerged as new tools for the health monitoring of large-scale structures due to their advantages of active sensing, low cost, quick response, availability in different shapes, and simplicity for implementation. In this research, piezoceramic transducers are used for damage detection of a 6.1m long reinforced concrete bridge bent-cap. Piezoceramic transducers are embedded in the concrete structure at pre-determined spatial locations prior to casting. This research can be considered as a continuation of an earlier work, where four piezoceramic transducers were embedded in planar locations near one end of the bent-cap. This research involves ten piezoceramic patches embedded at spatial locations in four different cross-sections. To induce cracks in the bent-cap, the structure is subjected to loads from four hydraulic actuators with capacities of 80 and 100ton. In addition to the piezoceramic sensors, strain gages, LVDTs, and microscopes are used in the experiment to provide reference data. During the experiment, one embedded piezoceramic patch is used as an actuator to generate high frequency waves, and the other piezoceramic patches are used as sensors to detect the propagating waves. With the increasing number and severity of cracks, the magnitude of the sensor output decreases. Wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the recorded sensor signals. A damage index is formed on the basis of the wavelet packet analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed methods of using piezoceramic transducers along with the damage index based on wavelet packet analysis are effective in identifying the existence and severity of cracks inside the concrete structure. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the ability to predict the failure of a concrete structure as verified by results from conventional microscopes (MSs) and LVDTs. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Monitoring systems currently applied to concrete bridges include strain gauges, inclinometers, accelerometers and displacement transducers. In general, vertical displacements are one of the parameters that more often need to be assessed because their information reflects the overall response of the bridge span. However, the implementation of systems to continuously and directly observe vertical displacements is known to be difficult. On the other hand, strain gauges and inclinometers are easier to install, but their measurements provide no more than indirect information regarding the bridge deflection. In this context, taking advantage of the information collected through strain gauges and inclinometers, and the processing capabilities of current computers, a procedure to evaluate bridge girder deflections based on polynomial functions is presented. The procedure has been implemented in an existing software system - MENSUSMONITOR -, improving the flexibility in the data handling and enabling faster data processing by means of real time visualization capabilities. Benefiting from these features, a comprehensive analysis aiming at assessing the suitability of polynomial functions as an approximate solution for deflection curves, is presented. The effect of boundary conditions and the influence of the order of the polynomial functions on the accuracy of results are discussed. Some recommendations for further instrumentation plans are provided based on the results of the present analysis.

  abstract = {Among different Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems applied on bridges, Bridge Weight-in-Motion (BWIM) is probably the one with widest applications worldwide. Briefly, BWIM uses on-structure sensors that are able to acquire signals sensitive to traffic load events, which can be used as an indirect indicator of the load magnitude. The sampling rate required for this is relatively high (at least 10\,Hz), which usually lead to databases with sizes that might reach the order of gigabytes. It is impractical to process this volume of information in the context of infrastructure asset management. Hence, an effective and efficient method for the compression and storage of BWIM data is becoming mandatory. In this paper, sparse representation algorithms have been innovatively applied to the BWIM data compression. A comparative study is performed based on measurements collected from a real bridge, by exploring different methods including Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and two dictionary learning methods, i.e. Compressive Sensing (CS) and K-means Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD). It has been found that the K-SVD method shows the best performance when applied to this specific type of data, while the DWT method using Haar wavelet is the most computationally efficient. Nearly lossless reconstruction of the signal is achieved by using K-SVD with less than 0.1\% reserved coefficients, which gives evidence that dictionary learning technologies are feasible to guarantee the same level of information even with much smaller databases. Therefore, the utilization of dictionary learning is a clear step forward towards higher levels of efficiency in the compression and storage of data collected by SHM systems.},

Dominant frequencies of the bridge span, in the range 3.18-3.63. Hz, were also computed. Evidence of possible lateral and longitudinal deflections was also found. Measurement noise and quality of results were controlled on the basis of the analysis of apparent displacements of reference points during excitation and of non-excitation intervals, as well as on the basis of structural constraints. The amplitude of measured deflections was found to correlate with the load, and a somewhat distinct oscillation waveform was observed in the cases of large oscillations, despite clipping affecting highly dynamic RTS recordings.

  abstract = {The accurate identification of modal parameters is a critical issue in the determination of features of civil structures. In this paper, a novel method based on the multisynchrosqueezing transform (MSST) is proposed to identify modal parameters, including natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of civil structures. The MSST consists of multiple operations of a synchrosqueezing transform so that the time-frequency representation of an analyzed signal becomes more concentrated, which allows more accurate decomposition of the signal. To identify modal parameters based on the MSST, first, the natural extraction technique is used to obtain a free vibration response from a measured ambient vibration response. Second, the free vibration response is decomposed into several modes by using the MSST, and mode shape vectors can be obtained from the decomposed modes for all measurements. Then, instantaneous phases and instantaneous amplitudes of the modes are obtained by using the Hilbert transform. Finally, a least-squares curve fitting technique is performed on the instantaneous phases and instantaneous amplitudes to extract natural frequencies and damping ratios. Two numerical examples, a 3-degree-of-freedom free vibration response signal and a four-story frame steel structure subjected to environmental vibration, are used to demonstrate the applicability of the MSST-based method. In addition, an experimental validation based on a pedestrian overpass, located in Tufts University, United States, is conducted. Case analyses indicate that the MSST-based method can easily identify high-quality natural frequencies and damping ratios from measurements of structures.},

The method utilizes model-based damage identification that involves three major steps: (1) efficient basis functions—extracted from finite-element (FE) models prior to real-time identification; (2) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses; and (3) the fusion of different types of structural responses into damage indicator. By treating local damages as equivalent vertical loads and then cross-referencing global (inclinations) and local (strain) data, the hidden damage information in bridge structures can be detected and localized in a timely fashion, even in the presence of unknown temperature variation as well as vehicle loads. Inclinations alone cannot reflect local damages, but by fusing inclinations and strains (that represent local damage) into the proposed damage indicator, local damages can be identified. Numerical simulations on a medium-span continuous bridge demonstrate that the proposed method is insensitive to measurement noise and some common modeling errors, revealing the potential of real-time damage identification in bridge SHM applications.},

  abstract = {Vehicle classification is the process of separating vehicles according to various predefined classes. Vehicle-classification information can be used in many transportation applications, including road maintenance, emissions/pollution estimation, traffic modeling and simulation, traffic safety, and toll setting. An example of a classification scheme using the following seven vehicle classes is presented: cars, sport-utility vehicles/ pickups, vans, limousines, buses, two-axle trucks, and trucks with more than two axles. This system uses vehicle inductive signatures collected from existing loop-detector infrastructure. It also uses a heuristic-discriminant algorithm for classification and a multi-objective optimization for training the heuristic algorithm. Feature vectors obtained by processing inductive signatures are used as inputs into the classification algorithm. Three different heuristic algorithms were developed, yielding encouraging results of 81 to 91 percent overall classification rates. The results demonstrate the potential of collecting network-wide vehicle-classification data from inductive loops. The availability of vehicle-classification data helps to improve traffic surveillance and better defines dynamic traffic networks.},

  abstract = {Wavelet transform (WT) is a mathematical tool that can decompose a temporal signal into a summation of time-domain basis functions of various frequency resolutions. This simultaneous time-frequency decomposition gives the WT a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing nonstationary signals. One drawback of the WT is that its resolution is rather poor in the high-frequency region. Since structural damage is typically a local phenomenon captured most likely by high frequency modes, this potential drawback can affect the application of the wavelet-based damage assessment techniques. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. In this study, a WPT-based method is proposed for the damage assessment of structures. Dynamic signals measured from a structure are first decomposed into wavelet packet components. Component energies are then calculated and used as inputs into neural network models for damage assessment. Numerical simulations are performed on a three-span continuous bridge under impact excitation. The results show that the WPT-based component energies are good candidate indices that are sensitive to structural damage. These component energies can be used for various levels of damage assessment including identifying damage occurrence, location, and severity.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of a portable roadside magnetic sensor system for vehicle counting, classification, and speed measurement. The sensor system consists of wireless anisotropic magnetic devices that do not require to be embedded in the roadway-the devices are placed next to the roadway and measure traffic in the immediately adjacent lane. An algorithm based on a magnetic field model is proposed to make the system robust to the errors created by larger vehicles driving in the nonadjacent lane. These false calls cause an 8\% error if uncorrected. The use of the proposed algorithm reduces this error to only 1\%. Speed measurement is based on the calculation of the cross correlation between longitudinally spaced sensors. Fast computation of the cross correlation is enabled by using frequency-domain signal processing techniques. An algorithm for automatically correcting for any small misalignment of the sensors is utilized. A high-accuracy differential Global Positioning System is used as a reference to measure vehicle speeds to evaluate the accuracy of the speed measurement from the new sensor system. The results show that the maximum error of the speed estimates is less than 2.5\% over the entire range of 5-27 m/s (11-60 mi/h). Vehicle classification is done based on the magnetic length and an estimate of the average vertical magnetic height of the vehicle. Vehicle length is estimated from the product of occupancy and estimated speed. The average vertical magnetic height is estimated using two magnetic sensors that are vertically spaced by 0.25 m. Finally, it is shown that the sensor system can be used to reliably count the number of right turns at an intersection, with an accuracy of 95\%. The developed sensor system is compact, portable, wireless, and inexpensive. Data are presented from a large number of vehicles on a regular busy urban road in the Twin Cities, MN, USA.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for material level system identification for damage assessment of a reinforced concrete structure using a modified version of the unscented Kalman filtering technique. The complete framework is based on nonlinear finite element model updating using constraint conditions, where the sigma points are generated within a pre-defined domain of the respective model parameters. The proposed framework updates the parameters using noisy measurements (i.e. acceleration, strain history, etc.), which are used for condition assessment using modified Park and Ang damage index. First, the proposed algorithm is validated using the simulated response of a multistory 2D moment resisting frame. The results of this numerical analysis show the efficiency of the proposed methodology for estimating the damage state of the structure excited by seismic ground motion. Finally, the performance of the proposed damage estimation algorithm is demonstrated using full-scale test results of a reinforced concrete bridge pier. It clearly shows the possibility to update element level material parameters, which is the main aim of this study. This element level parameter identification helps to quantify both in-situ local and global damage, which can be further utilized for decision-making prior to retrofitting/rehabilitation. Overall, the novelty of this work lies in the adaptation of the proposed constrained unscented Kalman filter algorithm for material level parameter estimation and its validation using experimental data.},

If the value computed for the original data is significantly different than the ensemble of values computed for the surrogate data, then the null hypothesis is rejected and nonlinearity is detected. We discuss various null hypotheses and discriminating statistics. The method is demonstrated for numerical data generated by known chaotic systems, and applied to a number of experimental time series which arise in the measurement of superfluids, brain waves, and sunspots; we evaluate the statistical significance of the evidence for nonlinear structure in each case, and illustrate aspects of the data which this approach identifies.},

Structural Health Monitoring has been used on major bridges and as a research tool for over 50 years. The instances of its application for long term continuous monitoring are in the 100's. During this period the condition of the world's inventory of bridges has steadily declined. Many industry experts are citing the need for better information to manage bridges in a more productive manner. The industry needs to transition to fact based decision making from engineering judgement based on visual inspection. Do those conditions exist now? How will the industry need to adapt to allow for mainstream implementation of measured performance and a timeline for this innovation. This talk will address the technical, organizational and economic requirements for SHM to become a true innovation and be put into successful and practical use as a tool for managing a bridge fleet over their life cycle. The technological state of SHM as of a couple of years ago and the application of internet of things (IoT) technology to structural health monitoring will be discussed. The minimization of required hardware and decentralized data management are some of the major innovations IoT brings to SHM. A case study involving the continuous monitoring of a fleet of 20 bridges is presented. Field data examples using live loads from traffic to estimate load distribution factors are shown. In addition histograms of traffic induced strains on simply supported short and medium span bridge are presented. Examples are presented of timber, prestressed concrete and steel girder bridges. In summary, continuous monitoring a fleet of bridges is now economically and technologically viable. Maybe some words about how data analysis is the future. © 2019 by DEStech Publications, Inc.

Such interdisciplinary research teams face many challenges resulting from differences in training and scientific culture. Interdisciplinary education programs are required to train truly interdisciplinary scientists with respect to the critical factor skills and competences. For that purpose this paper presents the Methodology for Interdisciplinary Research (MIR) framework. The MIR framework was developed to help cross disciplinary borders, especially those between the natural sciences and the social sciences. The framework has been specifically constructed to facilitate the design of interdisciplinary scientific research, and can be applied in an educational program, as a reference for monitoring the phases of interdisciplinary research, and as a tool to design such research in a process approach. It is suitable for research projects of different sizes and levels of complexity, and it allows for a range of methods’ combinations (case study, mixed methods, etc.). The different phases of designing interdisciplinary research in the MIR framework are described and illustrated by real-life applications in teaching and research. We further discuss the framework’s utility in research design in landscape architecture, mixed methods research, and provide an outlook to the framework’s potential in inclusive interdisciplinary research, and last but not least, research integrity.},

The SC has been implemented into a PMU prototype developed within the OpenPMU project using a BeagleBone Black (BBB) board. The distinctive feature of the proposed solution is its ability to track an input Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) reference with good long-term stability and with no need for specific on-board synchronization circuitry.

  abstract = {Since 2008, a sensor network deployed on a major Dutch highway bridge has been monitoring various structural and environmental parameters, including strain, vibration and climate, at different locations along the infrastructure. The aim of the InfraWatch project is to model the structural health of the bridge by analyzing the large quantities of data that the sensors produce. This paper focus on the identification of traffic events (passing cars/trucks, congestion, etc.). We approach the problem as a time series subsequence clustering problem. As it is known that such a clustering method can be problematic on certain types of time series, we verified known problems on the InfraWatch data. Indeed, some of the undesired phenomena occurred in our case, but to a lesser extent than previously suggested. We introduce a new distance measure that discourages this observed behavior and allows us to identify traffic events reliably, even on large quantities of data.},

  abstract = {The serviceability of a bridge is generally analyzed by a comparison between the vertical deflections expected by the engineer and those measured during a load test or in the long term. The existing methods do not allow the determination of the vertical displacements from the measurements carried out by a network of deformation sensors placed inside the bridge. The mathematical model presented here allows the determination of the displacement field from internal horizontal deformation measurements and helps in the design of the required sensor network. This model was tested on an experimental model and on the Lutrive Highway Bridge (Switzerland) by comparing the changes in vertical displacements under daily temperature variations obtained with the proposed method, with those measured directly using an absolute hydrostatic leveling system. Fiber optic deformation sensors and electrical inclinometers were used to carry out the measurements. With this deformation monitoring system, featuring a precision of 10 Fm on 1 m long deformation sensors, it is possible to retrieve the vertical displacement field of a beam with a global error less than 8 percent.},

Discrete Event systems Specification (DEVS) provides a formal framework for hierarchical construction of discrete-event models in a modular manner, allowing for model re-use and reduced development time.  Discrete Event Modeling and Simulation presents a practical approach focused on the creation of discrete-event applications. The book introduces the CD++ tool, an open-source framework that enables the simulation of discrete-event models. After setting up the basic theory of DEVS and Cell-DEVS, the author focuses on how to use the CD++ tool to define a variety of models in biology, physics, chemistry, and artificial systems. They also demonstrate how to map different modeling techniques, such as Finite State Machines and VHDL, to DEVS. The in-depth coverage elaborates on the creation of simulation software for DEVS models and the 3D visualization environments associated with these tools.  A much-needed practical approach to creating discrete-event applications, this book offers world-class instruction on the field’s most useful modeling tools.},

  abstract = {Abnormal event detection is one of the most important objectives in security surveillance for public scenes. In this paper, a new high-performance algorithm based on spatio-temporal motion information is proposed to detect global abnormal events from the video stream as well as the local abnormal event. We firstly propose a feature descriptor to represent the movement by adopting the covariance matrix coding optical flow and the corresponding partial derivatives of multiple connective frames or the patches of the frames. The covariance matrix of multi-RoI (region of interest) which consists of frames or patches can represent the movement in high accuracy. For public surveillance video, the normal samples are abundant while there are few abnormal samples. Thus the one-class classification method is suitable for handling this problem inherently. The nonlinear one-class support vector machine based on a proposed kernel for Lie group element is applied to detect abnormal events by merely training the normal samples. The computational complexity and time performance of the proposed method is analyzed. The PETS, UMN and UCSD benchmark datasets are employed to verify the advantages of the proposed method for both global abnormal and local abnormal event detection. This method can be used for event detection for a surveillance video and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus it can be adopted to detect the abnormal event in the monitoring video.}

In this approach, the model updating is divided into two phases of free-standing tower phase and full-bridge phase according to the construction procedure, so that the model updating of the long-span suspension bridge can be greatly simplified. The physical meaning of sensitivity and the penalty function concept is employed in the iterative calculation. The structural model is updated by modifying the parameters of design, and validated by structural natural vibration characteristics and static responses. The design parameters used for updating are bounded according to measured static results and engineering judgments. After ambient vibration measurements were carried out to obtain the eigenfrequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of RSB based on the monitored acceleration records, the FE model is then updated by using the measurements come from field tests during construction of the bridge and after the completion of the bridge. The calibrated FE model is proved to have a good correlation with the static and dynamic measurements and is then used for the continuous structural health monitoring of the bridge.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This paper presents a novel singular value decomposition (SVD)-based guided wave array signal processing approach for relatively weak signals, which are usually encountered in long-range inspections. Because the scattered signals from a damaged area received by each element of a receiver array are from the same source, the damage information can be extracted from the covariance matrix of the array signals. By performing SVD of the covariance matrix of each part of the original array signals chosen by different time windows, the time of flight (ToF) of the damage-scattered signal corresponding to the largest singular value will be obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed SVD-based array signal processing method is then verified by a numerical analysis. Subsequently, experimental investigations are carried out on an orthotropic steel deck plate in an actual cable-stayed bridge and an 84-m-long steel pipe to verify the practicability of the SVD-based method. The results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective for array signal processing, especially for the signals with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the oil industry, more and more subsea pipelines enter into service, and thus we are facing the challenge of safe operation and maintenance of these underwater infrastructures. For instance, as a common component to connect subsea pipelines, the flange is prone to losing sufficient integrity due to severe working conditions and harsh environments under the sea. However, most of the current structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques are targeted at onshore structures, and we require a more practical method for multi-bolt looseness identification of subsea flanges. In this paper, attempting to solve the above difficulty, we propose the “Smart Crawfish”, which is a concept that employs a subsea robot equipped with a gripper and a pair of Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) transducers to implement the active sensing method. Particularly, the main computational contribution of this paper is that we develop two new entropy indexes, i.e., multiscale range entropy (MRangeEn) and multiscale bubble entropy (MbEn) to enhance the current active sensing method (i.e., the entropy-enhanced active sensing method). To detect underwater multi-bolt looseness, we first obtain stress wave signals under different categories (i.e., different cases of multi-bolt looseness) by the active sensing and then compute their MRangeEn and MbEn to construct the feature dataset. Subsequently, via the dataset, a stacking-based ensemble learning classifier is trained to classify different categories. Finally, we conduct a lab-level experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the current entropy-enhanced active sensing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to address the detection of underwater multi-bolt looseness, which has great potential for future industrial applications. © 2020},

  abstract = {The effects from passing vehicle's load on bridge are divided into two categories: static effect and dynamic effect. The static effect usually indicates the pseudo-static responses of the bridge caused by the vehicle gross weight while the dynamic effect means dynamic responses due to vehicle and bridge dynamic properties and bridge pavement roughness. Both effects need to be properly evaluated because the vehicle static weight is a governing factor in determining bridge's fatigue life while the dynamic part of the vehicle load tends to amplify the bridge responses. In this paper, a method based on an extended Kalman filter is proposed to identify vehicle static and dynamic load only from responses recorded by portable accelerometers, together with their transverse position, which affects the identification of the loads. Even though only accelerometers are employed as sensors, the bridge vertical acceleration can capture the dynamic load components and the inclination obtained from the projection of the gravitational acceleration in the longitudinal direction can capture the low-frequency component. The feasibility of the proposed method is proved through numerical simulation and an experimental test on a bridge. This paper makes full use of three-axis accelerometers to estimate vehicle's static and dynamic load considering the vehicle's passing route, thus solving the nonlinear problem caused by vehicle's transverse position. Moreover, the proposed method eliminates the need of using other devices like displacement sensor or strain gauges to obtain low-frequency components.},

  abstract = {With an increase in bridge service time, damage will inevitably occur. Accurately identifying damage is of great significance to the operation and maintenance of a bridge. To realize a frequent identification of local stiffness reduction caused by structural damage in operation, this paper proposes a new method for damage localization of short-span bridges based on the axle weight time history identified by bridge weigh-in-motion technology. This method is based on a least squares QR decomposition recursive algorithm, and the orthogonal matrix is updated by the newly added measured rotation response and the axle weight identified in the previous step to recursively obtain the current axle weight. Then, the axle weight time history is obtained and the damage is located according to the mutation of axle weight time history caused by the first axle passing through the damage. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed method are verified by a numerical model of a simply supported beam. The results show that the axle weight time history has a strong sensitivity to damage, and the average normalized axle weight time history can accurately locate the damage and significantly reduce the impact of environmental noise. This method can be used for long-term health monitoring of bridge structures.},

However, the data analysis techniques and, in particular, the technology conceived years ago that are necessary for accurately and efficiently extracting condition assessment measures from highway infrastructure have just recently begun maturation. In this study, a large-scale wireless sensor network is deployed for ambient vibration testing of a single-span integral abutment bridge to derive in-service modal parameters. Dynamic behavior of the structure from ambient and traffic loads was measured with accelerometers for experimental determination of the natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of the bridge. Real-time data collection from a 40-channel single network operating with a sampling rate of 128~Hz per sensor was achieved with essentially lossless data transmission. Successful acquisition of high-rate, lossless data on the highway bridge validates the proprietary wireless network protocol within an actual service environment. Operational modal analysis is performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the acquisition hardware with additional correlation of the derived modal parameters to a Finite Element Analysis of a model developed using as-built drawings to check plausibility of the mode shapes. Results from this testing demonstrate that wireless sensor technology has matured to the degree that modal analysis of large civil structures with a distributed network is a currently feasible and a comparable alternative to cable-based measurement approaches.},

In this paper, we present WiTraffic: the first WiFi-based traffic monitoring system. Compared with existing solutions, it is non-intrusive, cost- effective, and easy-to-deploy. Unique WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) patterns of passing vehicles are captured and analyzed to effectively perform vehicle classification, lane detection, and speed estimation. A machine learning technique is adopted to train vehicle classification models and efficiently categorize vehicles. An Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)-based vehicle lane detection algorithm and vehicle speed estimation mechanism are proposed to further utilize WiFi CSI to identify the lane in which a vehicle is located and to estimate the vehicle speed. We implemented WiTraffic with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and performed real-world experiments with over a week of field data collection in both local roads and highways. The results show that the mean classification accuracy, lane detection accuracy for both local road and highway settings are around 96\%, and 95\%, respectively. The average root-mean- square error (RMSE) of the proposed CSI-based speed estimation method on a highway was 5mph in our experimental settings. © 2017 IEEE.},

Although the terminology might change between disciplines, the problems faced, and the methods of solution, show great commonality. The objective of this paper is to discuss how Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is carried out in the context of aerospace and civil structural monitoring and to draw parallels with how damage detection is conducted within the electrical, control and process engineering communities. A four-stage methodology for SHM, based on machine learning is discussed. The different levels of diagnostic information available depend on the type of data available for learning and this is also discussed. Detection alone can be carried out using normal condition data only and this is achieved using supervised learning where detection thresholds are critical. If damage state data are available, supervised learning can be applied and more diagnostic information becomes available. The various concepts are discussed in terms of a number of case studies drawn from wind turbine monitoring programmes; this allows the illustration of both SHM methods and machine condition monitoring methods. The possibility of moving towards a population-based approach to SHM applicable to systemsof-systems is outlined via one of the case studies. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the engineering discipline of diagnosing damage and estimating safe remaining life for structures and systems. Often, SHM is accomplished by detecting changes in measured quantities from the structure of interest; if there are no competing explanations for the changes, one infers that they are the result of damage. If the structure of interest is subject to changes in its environmental or operational conditions, one must understand the effects of these changes in order that one does not falsely claim that damage has occurred when changes in measured quantities are observed. This problem – the problem of confounding influences – is particularly pressing for civil infrastructure where the given structure is usually openly exposed to the weather and may be subject to strongly varying operational conditions. One approach to understanding confounding influences is to construct a data-based response surface model that can represent measurement variations as a function of environmental and operational variables. The models can then be used to remove environmental and operational variations so that change detection algorithms signal the occurrence of damage alone. The current paper is concerned with such response surface models in the case of SHM of bridges. In particular, classes of response surface models that can switch discontinuously between regimes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Traffic loading monitoring plays an important role in bridge structural health monitoring, which is helpful in overloading detection, transportation management, and safety evaluation of transportation infrastructures. Bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) is a method that treats traffic loading monitoring as an inverse problem, which identifies the traffic loads of the target bridge by analyzing its dynamic strain responses. To achieve accurate prediction of vehicle loads, the configuration of axles and vehicle velocity must be obtained in advance, which is conventionally acquired via additional axle-detecting sensors. However, problems arise from additional sensors such as fragile stability or expensive maintenance costs, which might plague the implementation of BWIM systems in practice. Although data-driven methods such as neural networks can estimate traffic loadings using only strain sensors, the weight data of vehicles crossing the bridge is difficult to obtain. In order to overcome these limitations, a modified encoder-decoder architecture grafted with signal-reconstruction layer is proposed in this paper to identify the properties of moving vehicles (i.e., velocity, wheelbase, and axle weight) using merely the bridge dynamic response. Encoder-decoder is an unsupervised method extracting higher features from original data. The numerical bridge model based on vehicle-bridge coupling vibration theory is established to illustrate the applicability of this new encoder-decoder method. The identification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict traffic loadings without using additional sensors and without requiring vehicle weight labels. Parametric studies also show that this new approach achieves better stability and reliability in identifying the properties of moving vehicles, even under the circumstances of large data pollution.},

However, features that are extracted from the acoustic measurements are time-varying and contain a lot of uncertainties, which makes the classification challenging. Since it is impossible to establish precise mathematical models to describe these variations and uncertainties contained in the features, we have applied fuzzy set and fuzzy logic theories to model and manage them, and have proposed three fuzzy logic rule-based classifier (FL-RBC) architectures -- non-hierarchical, hierarchical in parallel and hierarchical in series -- for the multi-category classification of ground vehicles. These FL-RBC architectures have been implemented based on both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic theories. We have also conducted experiments on our proposed FL-RBC architectures as well as on a Bayesian classifier to evaluate their performances. The experiments have shown that for this multi-category classification problem, (1) all FL-RBC architectures perform much better than the Bayesian classifier, (2) the type-2 FL-RBC architectures perform better than their competing type-1 implementations, (3) the type-2 non-hierarchical and hierarchical in series FL-RBC architectures perform the best, and (4) the performance of a classifier can be improved by incorporating decision fusion.},

Traditional weight-in-motion techniques are capable of identifying moving vehicles with satisfactory accuracy and stability, whereas the cost and construction induced issues are inevitable. A recently proposed traffic sensing methodology, combining computer vision techniques and traditional strain based instrumentation, achieves obvious overall improvement for simple traffic scenarios with less passing vehicles, but are enfaced with obstacles in complicated traffic scenarios. Therefore, a traffic monitoring methodology is proposed in this paper with extra focus on complicated traffic scenarios. Rather than a single sensor, a network of strain sensors of a pre-installed bridge structural health monitoring system is used to collect redundant information and hence improve accuracy of identification results. Field tests were performed on a concrete box-girder bridge to investigate the reliability and accuracy of the method in practice. Key parameters such as vehicle weight, velocity, quantity, type and trajectory are effectively identified according to the test results, in spite of the presence of one-by-one and side-by-side vehicles. The proposed methodology is infrastructure safety oriented and preferable for traffic load monitoring of short and medium span bridges with respect to accuracy and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The measurement of dynamic deflection is an important component of bridge loading                     experiments for high-speed railway bridges, but it is difficult to do directly                     for some long high-speed railway bridges. The deflection curve of the bridge in                     theory can be obtained by integrating the inclination curve of the bridge. This                     may be a good indirect method for dynamic deflection measurements of high-speed                     railway bridges if it meets two conditions: first, it must use a high-precision                     inclinometer to get a high-precision inclination curve of the bridge, and                     second, it must have a reliable integration method to calculate the deflection                     curve from the inclination curve. Based on this theory, the authors propose a                     new indirect dynamic deflection measurement method that uses precision                     inclinometers and a reliable integration method to measure the dynamic                     deflection curves of high-speed railway bridges. First, the authors designed a                     precision inclinometer called the QY inclinometer; second, the authors propose                     an inclinometer placement optimization method and a reliable integration method;                     last, two comparison experiments are conducted to prove this method on the Baima                     River Bridge. Test results indicate that this method can achieve the same                     accuracy as the method that uses cable-displacement sensors to test deflection                     and can achieve 0.01-mm accuracy. These experiments also prove indirectly that                     QY inclinometers have high precision and a response that is rapid enough to                     produce a dynamic intimation curve of a beam bridge when a train runs across it                     at high speed; the integration method proposed in this paper is also reliable.                     Compared with other methods of dynamic deflection measurement, this indirect                     measurement method is very easy to execute and does not need a static reference                     point to install inclinometers, and it can measure the static and dynamic                     deflection of any long- or short-beam bridge.},

The measurement data are analysed in this paper to obtain the mean wind speed, mean wind direction, mean wind inclination, turbulence intensity, integral scale, gust factor, wind spectrum, and the acceleration response and natural frequency of the Bridge. It is found that some features of wind structure and bridge response are difficult to be considered in the currently used analytical process for predicting buffeting response of long suspension bridges, for the Bridge is surrounded by a complex topography and the wind direction of Typhoon Victor changes during its crossing.

The global positioning system (GPS) is the common choice for long-span bridge displacement monitoring but the measurement accuracy is not satisfactory. The purpose of this study is to improve the GPS accuracy using a practical data fusion method. Although the main algorithms of data fusion method based on multi-rate Kalman filter are already reported, the detail about how to select the noise parameters required for Kalman filter is not provided. This paper demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be used to determine the necessary noise parameters. The proposed approach was validated on numerical and field data, the latter from a single-day displacement monitoring campaign on the Humber Bridge in the UK. The direct measurement by GPS was merged with the collocated acceleration data and the resulting displacement signal was evaluated by comparing it to the displacement signal from an independent vision-based system. Through the comparison, it is shown that MLE enhanced data fusion is practical to improve the GPS measurement accuracy and to widen the frequency bandwidth. The MLE provides an estimation about the GPS noise (assumed as zero-mean Gaussian process) with the standard deviation varying from 6 mm to 16 mm in the test day. The normalised root mean square deviation of GPS measurement compared with the vision-based measurement was decreased from 3.17\% to 2.37\% after applying the data fusion.},

The installation of long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to the bridges has become a trend to monitor their loading conditions, assess their performance, detect their damage, and guide their maintenance with the utmost goals of ensuring their functionality, safety and sustainability. Nevertheless, it is not very clear how to make good use of SHM systems toward these goals. This paper takes the Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong as an example and recapitulates the relevant works done by the author and his colleagues and students in the past 20~years to manifest how the SHM system installed in the bridge has been utilized since 1997. The SHM system installed in the bridge is briefly introduced first. How to use the SHM system for investigating highway loading, railway loading, wind characteristics, and temperature effects is then presented. Identification of time-varying natural frequencies and modal damping ratio of the bridge under strong winds using the data recorded by the SHM system is also demonstrated. Toward the performance assessment and damage detection of the bridge, SHM system-based computer simulation and damage assessment are targeted and some typical examples are given. The establishment of SHM system-based bridge rating system for bridge maintenance is also briefly introduced.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

A wind and structural health monitoring system (WASHMS) has been installed in the bridge and operated by the Hong Kong Highways Department since 1997. The WASHMS is devised to carry out the monitoring of environmental status, traffic loads, bridge features and bridge responses. The environmental status includes temperature environment monitored by temperature sensors, whereas the bridge responses contain displacement responses recorded by displacement transducers, level sensing stations, and global positioning systems (GPS). Bridge displacement responses are, however, induced by a combination of four major types of loadings due to wind, temperature, highway, and railway. This investigation focuses on the temperature environment and the predominating temperature effect on the Tsing Ma Bridge. The main features and the pertinent monitoring system of the Tsing Ma Bridge are first introduced. The data collected from the four types of sensors are pre-processed. The statistics of ambient air temperature, effective temperature and displacement response of the bridge are then figured out based on the measurement data. The statistical relationship between the effective temperature and the displacement of the bridge is finally established. These results are useful for monitoring temperature effects on the Tsing Ma Bridge. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \&Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This study is devoted to the experimental validation of the multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction method for structural health monitoring of long-span suspension bridges. The method for multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction is briefly described. A test bed, comprising of a physical model and an updated finite element (FE) model of a long-span suspension bridge is also concisely introduced. The proposed method is then applied to the test bed; the equation of motion of the test bed subject to ground motion, the objective function for sensor location optimization, the principles for mode selection and multi-type response reconstruction are established. A numerical study using the updated FE model is performed to select the sensor types, numbers, and locations. Subsequently, with the identified sensor locations and some practical considerations, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, laser displacement transducers, and accelerometers are installed on the physical bridge model. Finally, experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the reconstructed responses using the measured responses from the limited number of multi-type sensors agree well with the actual bridge responses. The proposed method is validated to be feasible and effective for the monitoring of structural behavior of long-span suspension bridges.},

Approximately one hundred papers to date have appeared on this subject, investigating topics like system development and improvement, the viability on field applications and the potential for structural condition assessment. The main contribution of this paper is to present a literature review of vision-based displacement measurement, from the perspectives of methodologies and applications. Video-processing procedures in this paper are summarised as a three-component framework: camera calibration, target tracking and structural displacement calculation. Methods for each component are presented in principle, with discussions about the relative advantages and limitations. Applications in the two most active fields, bridge deformation and cable vibration measurement, are examined followed by a summary of field challenges observed in monitoring tests. Important gaps requiring further investigation are presented, e.g. robust tracking methods, non-contact sensing and measurement accuracy evaluation in field conditions.},

  abstract = {Land suitability evaluation (LSE) is an important step in land-use planning. Using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques based on geographic information systems is a flexible and effective approach for this evaluation process. Implementation of sensitivity analysis to validate and calibrate the MCDM can enhance the understanding of the LSE results and assist in making informed planning decisions. The main limitation of sensitivity analysis in MCDM applications is a lack of insight into the spatial dimensions. To address this issue, this paper presents a new framework that incorporates the spatial configuration information from sensitivity analysis for MCDM. The framework consists of a land suitability evaluation and a spatially explicit sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis couples spatial visualization and summary indicators, which include a traditional metric (i.e., the mean of the absolute change rate, MACR) and a novel spatially explicit metric (the Earth Mover's Distance, EMD). The newly reclaimed region of Yili in China was studied as the representative area. We assumed that the weights were the only source of uncertainty and used a one-dimensional sensitivity analysis. This experiment indicated that the expert LSE results for wheat are robust but relatively sensitive in local areas to changes in the weights. Our results confirm that the MACR and EMD can effectively identify sensitive parameters based on various sensitivity aspects. The EMD explores the new information from the spatial dimensions, which differs from traditional methods for sensitivity analysis. This approach provides a suitable framework based on a spatially explicit sensitivity analysis for the effective implementation of MCDM for robust LSE results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first generation of sensor networks for structural monitoring are likely to be data acquisition systems that collect data at a single node for centralized processing. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of a wireless sensor network system (called Wisden) for structural data acquisition. Wisden incorporates two novel mechanisms, reliable data transport using a hybrid of end-to-end and hop-by-hop recovery, and low-overhead data time-stamping that does not require global clock synchronization. We also study the applicability of wavelet-based compression techniques to overcome the bandwidth limitations imposed by lowpower wireless radios. We describe our implementation of these mechanisms on the Mica-2 motes and evaluate the performance of our implementation. We also report experiences from deploying Wisden on a large structure.},

This research studies the effects of temperature and age on the development of concrete elastic modulus by a series of prism specimens. Elastic modulus test was conducted at various temperatures and ages in the laboratory to examine the effects of temperature and age on it. The experimental results reveal that the concrete elastic modulus decreases with the rise of temperature but increases with age. Then, a temperature coefficient K is proposed to describe the effects of temperature and validated by existing studies. Finally, on the basis of K, analytical models are proposed to determine the elastic modulus of concrete at a given temperature and age. The proposed models can offer designers an approach to obtain more accurate properties of concrete structures through the elastic modulus modification based on actual age and temperature, rather than using a value merely based on laboratory testing.},

  abstract = {Temperature-based structural identification (TBSI) is a quantitative structural evaluation approach that relies on responses resulting from temperature fluctuations. Through this approach, the transfer function that defines how thermal induced strains give rise to global displacements and restrained member forces can be captured. This input-output relationship is highly sensitive to mechanisms that pose modeling challenges, such as boundary and continuity conditions, and thus is quite valuable within the model updating process. The method follows the traditional structural identification (St-Id) framework with a priori modeling, experimentation, and model calibration steps appropriately modified to allow for the measurement and simulation of temperature-induced responses. TBSI was evaluated through the use of simulations and laboratory experiments and then implemented to identify an arch bridge. In addition, a comparative study was performed with an independent evaluation of the same bridge using ambient vibration structural identification (AVSI). The results indicate that TBSI and AVSI are synergistic providing complementary information related to a diverse range of structural performances. In addition, the results illustrate several TBSI strong points, including (1) the ability to identify both linear and nonlinear behaviors, (2) the ability to efficiently capture response patterns with long periods, and (3) a strong correlation between the captured transfer function and the behavior of boundary and continuity conditions.

  abstract = {Multi-girder prestressed concrete bridges are a very common structural form for bridges around the world. Their continued use is expected in the future given the advantages these structures have with respect to speed of construction, reduced maintenance and improved material efficiency. However, the in-service behaviour of these types of structures, such as their load distribution characteristics, support boundary conditions and the contribution of secondary elements, is still not well understood, and few studies have investigated these areas in depth. Gaining better insight into these aspects of bridge behaviour will enable more realistic structural assessment and thus facilitate more targeted maintenance and refurbishment of these bridges. This paper evaluates the in-service structural behaviour of an operational prestressed concrete railway bridge, which has been monitored using a dense network of fibre optic strain and temperature sensors since it was constructed in 2015. In particular, the normalised curvature profiles and the neutral axis positions across the composite solid slab bridge deck may be used to extract information about the bridge’s transverse load distribution behaviour, support boundary conditions and the stiffness contribution of secondary elements. Using this information, structural model validation and updating were performed with the goal of providing a more realistic assessment of structural behaviour and structural capacity. The proposed methodology and workflow in this study provide new insights into the real performance of multi-girder prestressed concrete bridges and thus can be used to improve their operation, maintenance, assessment and refurbishment.},

The results demonstrate that the sensing node is low in energy consumption, high in strength, IPX8 waterproof, and high in sensitivity and resolution. These characteristics can be applied to practical road environments. Two sensing nodes were spaced apart in the direction of travelling. In the experiment, three types of vehicles passed by the monitoring points at several different speeds and values of d (the distance between the sensor and the nearest tire center line). Based on cross-correlation with kernel pre-smoothing, a calculation method was applied to process the raw data. New algorithms for traffic flow, speed, and axle length were proposed.

  abstract = {Today, bridge owners must consider increasing traffic demands (in both volume and weight) and also face concerns related to sustainability, resilience and liveability which were virtually unknown in the 1950s. Furthermore, legislators demand data-driven asset management decisions based on objective, quantitative and reliable bridge condition and performance evaluation. To explore the current state-of-the-art in objective performance and condition evaluation of constructed systems by leveraging technology, a 30-year old freeway bridge in New Jersey, exhibiting multiple complex performance deficiencies, was transformed into a field laboratory. To identify the root causes of performance concerns, Visual Inspection, Operational Monitoring, Forced Excitation Testing, Controlled Load Testing, Non-destructive Probes, Long-term Monitoring, Finite Element Modelling and Parameter Identification were conducted within a Structural Identification framework. The results showed that root causes of some performance deficiencies of the test bridge were identified definitively only through the application of field measurements and analyses integrated by following a scientific approach—i.e. Structural Identification. Controlled Proof-Load Testing was especially useful in demonstrating the location and impacts of damage and the remaining capacity although such an approach can only be considered for the most critical cases due to its high cost and disruption to operations. Operational monitoring was shown as a sufficient and much cheaper alternative for structural identification permitting the development of a 3D digital twin of the bridge, which proved critical in identifying the root causes of its deficiencies and formulating meaningful interventions. Without an a-priori model used for designing the experiments as well as a model (i.e. a digital twin) calibrated by parameter identification and used for simulations, it was not possible to offer options for corrective measures confidently. The study demonstrated the challenges in relying only on visual inspection when a multitude of interdependent mechanisms lead to damage and deterioration, and the information value of different experimental methods such as vibration testing, proof load testing, wide-area NDE scans and multi-year SHM in being able to understand the root causes of various damages.},

Initially, the short baseline trial is conducted to study the precision and characteristics of such kind of receivers as well as the potential applications of such a high-frequency data rate. After that, the performance of high-rate GPS receivers for dynamic response tracking is validated against accelerometers through controlled experimental tests and a novel kind of wavelet packet-based filtering method is also proposed. Finally, on-site dynamic experiments are carried out to measure the bridge deck oscillation induced by different external loads. Observed data are compared with predicted values derived from modeling undertaken with the finite element (FE) analysis software. The results of all the experiments proved to be very encouraging, and showed that high-rate GPS receiver is successful in quantifying both environmental induced bridge vibrations and high-frequency transient motion caused by vehicle loading, providing the ability for verification and/or improvement of structural design and modeling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a case study of a 100-km-long portion of an intelligent settlement monitoring system for the high-speed railway bridges (SMAIS) of the Beijing–Shanghai railway. The SMAIS consists of a sensor subsystem (SS), data acquisition and transmission subsystem (DAQ), data processing and analysis subsystem (DPA), database subsystem (DB), and data display and early warning subsystem (DEW). The SMAIS has the advantages of modularisation, low coupling, and interface standardisation. The general design principles of the SMAIS were studied, including its monitoring range calculation, monitoring point positions, and early warning threshold value determination. Proposals are made for the design of the SMAIS architecture and functions of its subsystems. The installation process and standard techniques for the SMAIS are also presented. The sensor precision test, temperature stability test, and general monitoring results are presented.

  abstract = {Careful selection and placement of sensors are the critical issue in the construction and implementation of an effective structural health monitoring system. A hybrid method termed the optimal sensor placement strategy (OSPS) based on multiple optimization methods is proposed in this paper. The initial sensor placement is firstly obtained by the QR factorization. Then, using the minimization of the off-diagonal elements in the modal assurance criterion matrix as a measure of the utility of a sensor configuration, the quantity of the sensors is determined by the forward and backward sequential sensor placement algorithm together. Finally, the locations of the sensor are determined by the dual-structure coding-based generalized genetic algorithm (GGA). Taking the scientific calculation software matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as a platform, an OSPS toolbox, which is working as a black box, is developed based on the command-line compiling and graphical user interface-aided graphical interface design. The characteristic and operation method of the toolbox are introduced in detail, and the scheme selection of the OSP is carried out on the world's tallest TV tower (Guangzhou New TV Tower) based on the developed toolbox. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective and the software package has a friendly interface, plenty of functions, good expansibility and is easy to operate, which can be easily applied in practical engineering.

  abstract = {In traditional time-based sampling, the sampling mechanism is triggered by predetermined sampling times, which are mostly uniformly spaced (i.e., periodic). Alternatively, in event-based sampling, some predefined events on the signal to be sampled trigger the sampling mechanism; that is, sampling times are determined by the signal and the event space. Such an alternative mechanism, setting the sampling times free, can enable simple (e.g., binary) representations in the event space. In real-time applications, the induced sampling times can be easily traced and reported with high accuracy, whereas the amplitude of a time-triggered sample needs high data rates for high accuracy.},

The distributed optical fiber sensor system and an algorithm to control as well as to analyze Brillouin gain spectrum signals were also developed. A single-mode optical fiber was attached in the longitudinal direction on the rail and the lower flange of the girder to be used as a sensing fiber of the BOCDA system. Changes in the girder’s strain at the center point of the bridge during the passage of a commercial train were measured at 9\,Hz, and the accuracy of this measurement was validated by comparing the measured data with the data from strain gauge. In addition, the distributed strain of a girder and the rail with a length of 40.26\,m was measured in real time with a spatial resolution of 31.1\,cm. Based on the results of the rail’s strain distribution, the study could identify the location where excessive strain occurred due to an influence of unsupported sleepers on girder of the bridge.},

  abstract = {Identification of moving loads on bridges is an important inverse problem in the civil and structural engineering field. It is an effective way to better understand the interaction between the bridge and vehicles traversing it in order to achieve a satisfactory lifespan for the future bridge design. The study on identification of moving loads has made a big progress over the past years. This paper reviews the current knowledge on factors affecting performance of moving force identification methods under main headings below: background of moving force identification, experimental verification in laboratory and its application in field. It mainly focuses on the potential of four developed identification methods, i.e. Interpretive Method I (IMI), Interpretive Method II (IMII), Time Domain Method (TDM) and Frequency-Time Domain Method (FTDM). Some parameter effects, such as vehicle-bridge parameters, measurement parameters and algorithm parameters, are also discussed. Although there are still many challenges and obstacles to be overcome before these methods can be implemented in practice, some conclusions that have been achieved on moving force identification are highlighted and recommendations served as a good indicator to steer the direction of further work in the field. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this paper, a method of damage assessment based on neural networks (NNs) is presented and applied to the Steelquake structure. The method is intended to assess the overall damage at each floor in composite frames caused by seismic loading. A neural network is used to calibrate the initial undamaged structure, and another to predict the damage. The natural frequencies of the structure are used as inputs of the NNs. The data used to train the NNs were obtained through a finite element (FE) model. Many previous approaches have exhibited a relatively poor capacity of generalisation. In order to overcome this problem, a FE model more suitable to the definition of damage is tried herein. Further work in this paper is concerned with the validation of the method. For this end, the damage levels of the structure were obtained through the trained NNs from the available experimental modal data. Then, the stiffness matrices of the structure predicted by the method were compared with those identified from pseudo-dynamic tests. Results are excellent. The new FE model definition allows the NNs to have a much better generalisation. The obtained values of the terms of the stiffness matrix of the undamaged structure are almost exact when comparing with the experimental ones, while the absolute differences are lower than 8.6\% for the damaged structure.},

Standard DCF77 receivers consist of AM long wave receiver circuit, connected to a data processing unit. Whole AM receiver circuit is often integrated into a chip with some external components. Such circuit gives demodulated logical data output, which can be led right to the processor to be decoded and presented. The idea is to remove the analog demodulator and process the amplified RF signal also on the processor. Specialized AM radio chip then would be replaced by a simple amplifier, e.g. operational amplifier circuit. Nowadays, microcontrollers include AD converters fast enough to digitalize signals at frequencies above 77.5 kHz. Using the advantages of undersampling, Goertzel algorithm and correlation techniques, it allows to make program very low computational power demanding.

The structural performance often decreases as a result of the change in condition. Objective condition assessment and performance evaluation are challenging activities since they require some type of monitoring to track the response over a period of time. In this paper, integrated use of video images and sensor data in the context of structural health monitoring is demonstrated as promising technologies for the safety of civil structures in general and bridges in particular. First, the challenges and possible solutions to using video images and computer vision techniques for structural health monitoring are presented. Then, the synchronized image and sensing data are analyzed to obtain unit influence line (UIL) as an index for monitoring bridge behavior under identified loading conditions. Subsequently, the UCF 4-span bridge model is used to demonstrate the integration and implementation of imaging devices and traditional sensing technology with UIL for evaluating and tracking the bridge behavior. It is shown that video images and computer vision techniques can be used to detect, classify and track different vehicles with synchronized sensor measurements to establish an input-output relationship to determine the normalized response of the bridge. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Structural degradation is an inevitable part of a structure’s service life. Detecting structural impairments and assessing their nature is a significant challenge. Degradations reduce structural system stiffness and subsequently affect system deformations. An appropriate structural health index that is able to capture these changes in deformation and relate them to a structural system stiffness may help engineers to adequately rate structural condition. This paper outlines a theoretical framework for the utilization of static deformation influence lines for estimating the flexural rigidity of Euler-Bernoulli beams. In the proposed technique, the relationship between the second derivative of the deformation influence line and the flexural rigidity for both statically determinate and indeterminate beam structures is presented. The proposed method provides a flexural rigidity estimate (FRE) over the entire span that is based on a single measurement location and estimates both the location and severity of impairments, regardless of the location of the measurement or the damaged zones. Noisy analytical simulations are presented with noise levels of 0\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 2\%, 3\%, and 4\%; in all cases the modeled damage is quantified and localized using the FRE. A laboratory experiment is also presented that validates the theoretical framework.},

  abstract = {Bridge structures decay throughout their lives even under nominal operating conditions. As bridge infrastructure ages and wears naturally or under extreme load, there is a need to monitor and evaluate bridge performance in an efficient way. This paper presents an impairment detection method that assesses the curvature of noisy static deformation influence lines to predict the location and severity of structural damage. In this method, a parametric approximation and two direct regularization methods i.e., Tikhonov Regularization (TR) and the proposed Iterative Multi-parameter Tikhonov Regularization (IMTR), are implemented to reduce the impact of measurement noise on flexural rigidity estimations. While the TR method assumes one regularization parameter for all unknowns of the optimization problem, the IMTR method has individual, iteratively optimized, regularization parameters for each unknown. To evaluate the performance of the presented method, four nominally identical beam structures with four different damage scenarios and multiple levels of measurement noise are studied. Combining the quadratic spline parametric approximation with either direct regularization method produces adequate curvature estimates that are subsequently used to predict the location and severity of damage. In cases of deep, sharp damage, the IMTR method improves the prediction performance by reducing percent error 4–32\%, for noise levels ranging from 0\% to 5\%, when compared to prediction results from the conventional TR. Both regularization methods give comparable results for shallow, wide damage. A laboratory experiment is included that presents the FRE on a statically indeterminate system; both TR and IMTR provide reasonable estimations of the location and severity of damage.},

Whether the structure is damaged or not, deflection could be precisely estimated via the finite-element model (FEM) combined with the partial least-square regression (PLSR) method. In addition, damage localization is achieved at the same time. First, the deflection of a damaged structure is equivalent to that of an undamaged structure but subjected to special virtual loads. Second, the basis functions used in regression are calculated by the FEM of the undamaged structure rather than pure mathematical derivations. Third, the PLSR model is built on the basis of these basis functions and measured inclination data. By solving the PLSR equation, all the nodal inclinations and corresponding nodal loads of the structure could be obtained despite a limited number of measured nodes. Finally, the rotation-displacement transfer matrix is derived to reconstruct deflection from estimated inclinations, and the changes in nodal loads are served as damage indicators. To verify its effectiveness, numerical simulations considering various damage scenarios and different noise levels are performed. The results indicate that the proposed method is quite accurate and reliable in deflection estimation, and it could provide rough damage localization as well, which reveals a great potential in the field of structural health monitoring. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {An innovative damage detection method for bridge structures under moving vehicular load is proposed on the basis of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and \emph{l}1-norm regularization. An augmented state vector includes structural damage parameters and motion state variables of bridge and vehicle. Through a recursive process of the EKF, the structural damage parameters and state variables of a bridge are updated continually to obtain an optimal estimate using bridge responses due to a moving vehicle. The distribution of element stiffness reduction of a structure with local damages is sparse. Thus, \emph{l}1-norm regularization is introduced into the updating process of the EKF using pseudo-measurement (PM) technology to improve the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Numerical studies on a simple-supported and continuous beam bridge deck, with a smooth road surface that is subject to a moving vehicle, are performed to test the proposed approach. Furthermore, using the robustness of the EKF, the proposed algorithm is applied as a simplified method to the case where a bridge deck with road roughness is considered. Results show that the proposed identification algorithm is robust and effective for different vehicle speeds and measurement noises under smooth and good road conditions.}

Compared with conventional BOF, EMD-based BOF is insensitive to vector quantization and can explore the relations among visual codes. In addition, such relations can be utilized as a key discriminative feature for image classification task. However, EMD is not practically utilized because of expensive computational cost. Motivated by Pele and Werman, we propose a faster approximate EMD (AEMD), and our AEMD-based BOF can inherit the advantages of EMD.

We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal information of the vehicles on a bridge is important evidence for reflecting the stress state and traffic density of the bridge. A methodology for obtaining the information is proposed based on computer vision technology, which contains the detection by Faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), multiple object tracking, and image calibration. For minimizing the detection time, the ZF (Zeiler \& Fergus) model with five convolutional layers is selected as the shared part between Region Proposal Network and Fast R-CNN in Faster R-CNN. An image data set including 1,694 images is established about eight types of vehicles for training Faster R-CNN. Combined with the detection of each frame of the video, the methods of multiple object tracking and image calibration are developed for acquiring the vehicle parameters, including the length, number of axles, speed, and the lane that the vehicle is in. The method of tracking is mainly based on the judgment of the distances between the vehicle bounding boxes in virtual detection region. As for image calibration, it is based on the moving standard vehicles whose lengths are known, which can be regarded as the 3D template to calculate the vehicle parameters. After acquiring the vehicles' parameters, the spatiotemporal information of the vehicles can be obtained. The proposed system has a frame rate of 16 fps and only needs two cameras as the input device. The system is successfully applied on a double tower cable-stayed bridge, and the identification accuracies of the types and number of axles are about 90 and 73\% in the virtual detection region, and the speed errors of most vehicles are less than 6\%.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A novel mathematical model which can precisely calculate the amplification ratio of a bridge-type amplification mechanism has been proposed. The elastic beam theory and the Castigliano's second theorem were utilized to establish the mathematical model with consideration of the deformation of input beams, output beam, connecting beams and flexure hinges. The proposed model was compared with existing theoretical models and finite element model (FEM), and the results validated that the proposed model featured a better performances and was the most proximal model to the FEM analysis. With the interval of the adjacent flexible hinges changed, the error at the peak of amplification ratio with the FEM was limited to 6.76\%, which was lower than most of the typical existing models. To further verify the effectiveness and expansibility of the proposed method, a decoupled XY precision positioning stage was investigated. Considering the influence of the loading force exerted on amplification mechanism, the displacement amplification ratio model of the positioning stage was established, and the results were further proved through the finite element simulation. The experimental results presented that the amplification ratios for X-direction and Y-direction motions are 5.83 and 5.71, the measured workspace of the stage is 174.9\,μm\,×\,171.3\,μm, and the cross-coupling error was evaluated to less than 3\%.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {The inherent uncertainties in experimental data have been recognized as one of the main barriers against the application of vibration-based damage identification techniques on real-life bridges. A statistical damage identification procedure for bridge health monitoring is presented in this paper. It is assumed that the structure, in both healthy and unknown conditions, is monitored and the dynamic responses under ambient excitations are available. The damage identification procedure runs following a 4-step scheme including (1) data sample formation, (2) data normalization, (3) damage feature extraction, and (4) statistical damage evaluation. A hierarchical sequence matching scheme is suggested for data normalization to account for the effects of various environmental and operational conditions on the structural dynamics. The damage feature extraction technique based on time series analysis combining auto-regressive and auto-regressive with eXogenous inputs prediction models is adopted. A statistical index based on the damage features that are derived from a large number of data samples is proposed for novelty detection and damage localization. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by numerical simulations performed on a three-span continuous girder bridge with reasonable damage severity.},

The vibration data are, however, often influenced by various environmental effects, which may degrade diagnosis performance and result in erroneous decisions. This paper focuses on understanding the consequence of significant environmental effects, such as trains passing nearby, on building vibration data using event detection methods and causal analysis. The event detection methods identify significant events using wavelet analysis, which is effective for decomposing non-stationary signals. The causal analysis allows us to investigate wave propagation patterns in structures by quantifying causal dependencies between measurements collected from different locations using directed information. These methods are applied to acceleration data collected from 40 accelerometers deployed to an 11-story office building located next to railway. The results show clear patterns of causal dependencies among vibration data from different locations in the building, and their patterns change under different environmental conditions. It provides insights about environmental loading effects on building vibration that can be helpful for improving the accuracy of damage diagnosis},

  abstract = {Recent developments in sensing and computer technology have resulted in most manufacturing processes becoming a data-rich environment. A cycle-based signal refers to an analog or digital signal that is obtained during each repetition of an operation cycle in a manufacturing process. It is a very important class of in-process sensing signals for manufacturing processes because it contains extensive information on the process condition and product quality (e.g., the forming force signal in forging processes). In contrast with currently available supervised classification approaches that heavily depend on the training dataset or engineering field knowledge, this paper aims to develop an automatic feature selection method for the unsupervised clustering of cycle-base signals. First, principal component analysis is applied to the raw signals. Then a new method is proposed to select information containing principal components to allow clustering to be performed. The dimension of the problem can be significantly reduced through the use of these two steps. Finally, a model-based clustering method is applied to the selected principal components to find the clusters in the cycle-based signals. A numerical example and a real-world example of a forging process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed technique is an important data pre-processing technique for the monitoring and diagnostic system development using cycle-based signals for manufacturing processes. © 2005 "IIE".},

  abstract = {Accurate information regarding the weight of vehicle loads plays a significant role in maintaining the structural health of bridges. However, the only method currently available for ascertaining the weight of loads is the bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) system, which is not widely used because of the high cost of the large device involved. There is therefore a need to develop an effective, low-cost technology to ascertain vehicle loads in relation to spatiotemporal load distribution on long-span bridges. This paper proposes a non-contact vehicle identification methodology to distinguish a vehicle from its load based on machine vision technology and deep learning algorithms. The vehicle information (i.e., type, weight, position, and motion trajectory, etc.) is conveniently obtained from a roadside monitoring surveillance camera, while the axle-weight distribution interval for nine classified vehicle types is obtained from the statistical information of 8402 delivery vehicles from which the relationship between a unique vehicle type and the corresponding weight information is established. Meanwhile, a dataset containing 8624 vehicle images was established for training the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), where nine rough-grained vehicle classifications were contained in order to enhance the generalizability of the network. Optimization analysis was conducted to improve the network accuracy in vehicle types identification. The position of vehicles can also be effectively detected by a faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), where the pre-trained DCNN with 98.17\% vehicle types classification accuracy is employed as the co-shared network layer to enhance computation efficiency. Utilizing the object detection results from the Faster R-CNN and utilizing a Kalman filter, a vehicle in motion could also be simultaneously real-time tracked by the monitoring video, while a graphical user interface (GUI) incorporated into the video camera enabled automatic identification. A post-processing module has been established based on the proposed method, and a field test was conducted to validate the reliability of the system.},

To estimate the relative depth of the cracks, a damage factor is established which relates the size of the cracks to the coefficients of the wavelet transform.

This paper describes advancements in accuracy and long-term stability of the B-WIM systems that were achieved within a 2-year research project financed by the European Commission.
